=== Performance tuning

Rudder and some applications used by Rudder (like the Apache web server, or Jetty)
can be tuned to your needs.

==== Reports retention

To lower Rudder server's disk usage, you can configure the retention duration 
for node's execution reports in 
+/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties+ file with the options:
 
+rudder.batch.reportscleaner.archive.TTL=30+

+rudder.batch.reportscleaner.delete.TTL=90+

==== Apache web server

The Apache web server is used by Rudder as a proxy, to connect to the Jetty
application server, and to receive inventories using the WebDAV protocol.

There are tons of documentation about Apache performance tuning available on the
Internet, but the defaults should be enough for most setups.

==== Jetty

The Jetty application server is the service that runs Rudder web application and inventory
endpoint. It uses the Java runtime environment (JRE).

The default settings fit the basic recommendations for minimal Rudder hardware requirements,
but there are some configuration switches that you might need to tune to obtain better
performance with Rudder, or correct e.g. timezone issues.

To look at the available optimization knobs, please take a look at +/etc/default/rudder-jetty+
on your Rudder server.

==== Java "Out Of Memory Error"

It may happen that you get java.lang.OutOfMemoryError. 
They can be of several types,
but the most common is: "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space".

This error means that the web application needs more RAM than what was given.
It may be linked to a bug where some process consumed much more memory than
needed, but most of the time, it simply means that your system has grown and needs
more memory.

You can follow the configuration steps described in the following paragraph.

==== Configure RAM allocated to Jetty

To change the RAM given to Jetty, you have to: 

----

# edit /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-jetty.conf with your preferred text editor, for example vim:
vim /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-jetty.conf

# modify JAVA_XMX to set the value to your need. 
# The value is given in MB by default, but you can also use the "G" unit to specify a size in GB.

JAVA_XMX=2G

# save your changes, and restart Jetty: 
service restart rudder-jetty

----

The amount of memory should be the half of the RAM of the server, rounded down to the nearest GB.
For example, if the server has 5GB of RAM, 2GB should be used.

==== Optimize PostgreSQL server

The default out-of-the-box configuration of PostgreSQL server is really not
compliant for high end (or normal) servers. It uses a really small amount of
memory.

The location of the PostgreSQL server configuration file is usually:

----

/etc/postgresql/9.x/main/postgresql.conf

----

On a SuSE system:

----

/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf

----



===== Suggested values on an high end server

----
#
# Amount of System V shared memory
# --------------------------------
#
# A reasonable starting value for shared_buffers is 1/4 of the memory in your
# system:

shared_buffers = 1GB

# You may need to set the proper amount of shared memory on the system.
#
#   $ sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=1073741824
#
# Reference:
# http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/interactive/kernel-resources.html#SYSVIPC
#
# Memory for complex operations
# -----------------------------
#
# Complex query:

work_mem = 24MB
max_stack_depth = 4MB

# Complex maintenance: index, vacuum:

maintenance_work_mem = 240MB

# Write ahead log
# ---------------
#
# Size of the write ahead log:

wal_buffers = 4MB

# Query planner
# -------------
#
# Gives hint to the query planner about the size of disk cache.
#
# Setting effective_cache_size to 1/2 of total memory would be a normal
# conservative setting:

effective_cache_size = 1024MB

----

===== Suggested values on a low end server

----

shared_buffers = 128MB
work_mem = 8MB
max_stack_depth = 3MB
maintenance_work_mem = 64MB
wal_buffers = 1MB
effective_cache_size = 128MB

==== CFEngine

If you are using Rudder on a highly stressed machine, which has especially slow or busy
I/O's, you might experience a sluggish CFEngine agent run everytime the machine
tries to comply with your Rules.

This is because the CFEngine agent tries to update its internal databases everytime the agent
executes a promise (the .lmdb files in the /var/rudder/cfengine-community/state directory),
which even if the database is very light, takes some time if the machine has a very high iowait.

In this case, here is a workaround you can use to restore CFEngine's full speed: you can use
a RAMdisk to store CFEngine states.

You might use this solution either temporarily, to examine a slowness problem, or permanently, to mitigate a
known I/O problem on a specific machine. We do not recommend as of now to use this on a whole IT infrastructure.

Be warned, this solution has a drawback: you should backup and restore the content of this directory
manually in case of a machine reboot because all the persistent states are stored here, so in case you are using,
for example the jobScheduler Technique, you might encounter an unwanted job execution because CFEngine will have
"forgotten" the job state.

Also, note that the mode=0700 is important as CFEngine will refuse to run correctly if the state directory is
world readable, with an error like:

----
error: UNTRUSTED: State directory /var/rudder/cfengine-community (mode 770) was not private!
----

Here is the command line to use:

.How to mount a RAMdisk on CFEngine state directory

----

# How to mount the RAMdisk manually, for a "one shot" test:
mount -t tmpfs -o size=128M,nr_inodes=2k,mode=0700,noexec,nosuid,noatime,nodiratime tmpfs /var/rudder/cfengine-community/state

# How to put this entry in the fstab, to make the modification permanent
echo "tmpfs /var/rudder/cfengine-community/state tmpfs defaults,size=128M,nr_inodes=2k,mode=0700,noexec,nosuid,noatime,nodiratime 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
mount /var/rudder/cfengine-community/state
