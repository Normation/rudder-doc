=== Application tuning

Some applications used by Rudder can be tuned to your needs, like Apache HTTPd.

==== Apache HTTPd

The apache HTTPd is used by Rudder as a proxying server, to connect to the Jetty
application server.

But it is also widely used as a regular HTTP serving application. You are heavily
advised if interested to read the tons of documentation about it in your Linux
distribution website, to learn about what it can do.

==== Jetty

The Jetty 7 (Hightide) application server is the main application that runs the
Rudder code. It is based on the Java programming language.

About the latter, there is some configuration switches that you might want to
tune to obtain better performance with Rudder, in /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-jetty.conf, whereas
the default ones fit the basic recommendations for the minimal Rudder hardware requirements.

* -Xms and Xmx: These parameters tune the total amount of RAM usable / dedicated to the
java process. It is what you want to tune at first to give Rudder some more RAM.

* -XX:PermSize -XX:MaxPermSize: These parameters are acceptable for most installations,
but you might want to decrease them a bit if using a machine that is not very powerful /
RAM abundant. Increasing them is not really useful.

==== CFEngine

If you are using Rudder on a highly stressed machine, which has especially slow or busy
I/O's, you might experience a sluggish CFEngine agent run everytime the machine
tries to comply with your Rules.

This is because the CFEngine agent tries to update its class database everytime the agent
executes a promise (the cf-lock.db file in the /var/rudder/cfengine-community/state directory),
which even if the database is very light, takes some time if the machine has a very high iowait value.

In this case, here is a workaround you can use to restore CFEngine's full speed: you can use
a RAMdisk to store CFEngine states.

You might use this solution either temporarily, to examine a slowness problem, or permanently, to mitigate a
known I/O problem on a specific machine. We do not recommend as of now to use this on a whole IT infrastructure.

Be warned, this solution has only one drawback: you should backup and restore the content of this directory
manually in case of a machine reboot because all the persistent states are stored here, so in case you are using,
for example the jobScheduler Technique, you might encounter an unwanted job execution because CFEngine will have
"forgotten" the job state.

Also, note that the mode=0700 is important as CFEngine will refuse to run correctly if the state directory is
world readable, with an error like:

----
error: UNTRUSTED: State directory /var/rudder/cfengine-community (mode 770) was not private!
----

Here is the command line to use:

# How to mount the RAMdisk manually, for a "one shot" test:
mount -t tmpfs -o size=128M,nr_inodes=2k,mode=0700,noexec,nosuid,noatime,nodiratime tmpfs /var/rudder/cfengine-community/state

# How to put this entry in the fstab, to make the modification permanent
echo "tmpfs /var/rudder/cfengine-community/state tmpfs defaults,size=128M,nr_inodes=2k,mode=0700,noexec,nosuid,noatime,nodiratime 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
mount /var/rudder/cfengine-community/state
