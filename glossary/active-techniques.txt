Active Techniques:: 

This is an organized list of the Techniques selected and modified by the
user. By default this list is the same as the Technique Libraryy.
Techniques can be disabled or deleted, and then activated again with a
simple drag and drop. Categories can be reorganised according to the desired
taxonomy. A Technique can appear only once in the Active Techniques list.
