=== Relay servers

Relay servers can be added to Rudder, for example to manage a DMZ or to isolate specific
nodes from the main environment for security reasons. 

Relay server's purpose is to solve a simple problem: sometimes, one would want to manage
multiple networks from Rudder, without having to allow all the subnet access to the other
for security reasons. A solution for this would be to have a kind of "Rudder" proxy that
would be relaying information between the subnet and the main Rudder server. This is the
reason relay servers were created.

Using a relay, you are able to:

- Separate your Rudder architecture into separate entities that still report to one server
- Prevent laxist security exceptions to the Rudder server
- Ease maintenance

The first part is to be done on the machine that will become a relay server.
The procedure will:

- Add the machine as a regular node
- Configure the relay components (Syslog, Apache HTTPd, CFEngine)
- Switch this node to the relay server role (from the root server point of view)

==== Installation procedure - On the relay

===== Install Rudder agent

To begin, please install a regular Rudder agent on the OS.

See <<install-agent, here>> for the complete reference about agent installation.

To complete this step, please make sure that your node is configured successfully
and appears in your Rudder web interface.

===== Install the required dependencies and enable required modules

----

# RHEL-like (RHEL, CentOS, Scientific)
yum install httpd httpd-tools rsyslog
# All required modules are enabled by default

# Debian-like (Debian, Ubuntu)
apt-get install apache2 apache2-utils rsyslog
a2enmod dav dav_fs
a2dissite default

# SuSE
zypper install apache2 apache2-utils rsyslog
a2enmod dav dav_fs

----

===== Create the necessary directory and adjust the permissions

----

mkdir -p /opt/rudder/etc /var/log/rudder/apache2 /var/rudder/share

for i in /var/rudder/inventories/incoming /var/rudder/inventories/accepted-nodes-updates
do
        mkdir -p ${i}
        chmod -R 1770 ${i}
        for group in apache www-data www; do
                if getent group ${group} > /dev/null; then chown -R root:${group} ${i}; break; fi
        done
done

for i in /opt/rudder/etc/htpasswd-webdav-initial /opt/rudder/etc/htpasswd-webdav
do
        /usr/bin/htpasswd -bc ${i} rudder rudder
done

touch /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-networks.conf

----

===== Please create the appropriate file for your OS, and copy the following content in it

- /etc/httpd/conf.d/rudder-default.conf file on RHEL-like
- /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/rudder-default file on Debian-like
- /etc/apache2/vhosts.d/rudder-default.conf file on SuSE

Finally, restart Apache to take these changes into account:

----

# RHEL-like (RHEL, CentOS, Scientific)
service httpd restart

# Debian-like (Debian, Ubuntu) and SuSE
service apache2 restart

----


==== Installation procedure - On the root server

===== Set the node as a Rudder relay

Launch the rudder-node-to-relay script on the root server, supplying the UUID of the
host to be added as a relay to it:

----

/opt/rudder/bin/rudder-node-to-relay aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeee

----

==== Result

When every step has completed successfully:

- The Rudder root server will recognize the new node as a relay
- It will generate specific promises for the relay
- The relay will update and switch to his new role

This is an example of node details pane showing a relay server. Note the "Role:
Rudder relay server" part that shows that the machine has successfully changed
from a node to a relay.

==== Adding nodes to a relay server

When you have at least one relay, you will likely want to add nodes
on it.

You then have two possible cases:

- You want to switch an already existing node to the relay
- You want to add a new one

The procedure on both cases is the same, you have to:

- Create / update the file /var/rudder/cfengine-community/policy_server.dat
with the IP address or the fully qualified domain name of the relay server
(instead of the root server)

----

echo "rudder-relay.example.com" > /var/rudder/cfengine-community/policy_server.dat

----


- Trigger an inventory immediately to make sure the node is registered correctly

----

rudder agent inventory

----

After those steps, the node should be registered correctly on your Rudder
infrastructure.
