=== Password management

You might want to change the default passwords used in Rudder's managed daemons
for evident security reasons.

==== Configuration of the postgres database password

You will have to adjust the postgres database and the rudder-web.properties file.

Here is a semi-automated procedure:

* Generate a decently fair password. You can use an arbitrary one too.

----

PASS=`dd if=/dev/urandom count=128 bs=1 2>&1 | md5sum | cut -b-12`

----

* Update the Postgres database user

----

su - postgres -c "psql -q -c \"ALTER USER blah WITH PASSWORD '$PASS'\""

----

* Insert the password in the rudder-web.properties file

----

sed -i "s%^rudder.jdbc.password.*$%rudder.jdbc.password=$PASS%" /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties

----

==== Configuration of the OpenLDAP manager password

You will have to adjust the OpenLDAP and the rudder-web.properties file.

Here is a semi-automated procedure:

* Generate a decently fair password. You can use an arbitrary one too.

----

PASS=`dd if=/dev/urandom count=128 bs=1 2>&1 | md5sum | cut -b-12`

----

* Update the password in the slapd configuration

----

HASHPASS=`/opt/rudder/sbin/slappasswd -s $PASS`
sed -i "s%^rootpw.*$%rootpw          $HASHPASS%" /opt/rudder/etc/openldap/slapd.conf

----

* Update the password in the rudder-web.properties file

----

sed -i "s%^ldap.authpw.*$%ldap.authpw=$PASS%" /opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties

----

==== Configuration of the WebDAV access password

This time, the procedure is a bit more tricky, as you will have to update
the Technique library as well as a configuration file.

Here is a semi-automated procedure:

* Generate a decently fair password. You can use an arbitrary one too.

----

PASS=`dd if=/dev/urandom count=128 bs=1 2>&1 | md5sum | cut -b-12`

----

* Update the password in the apache htaccess file

[TIP]

====

On some systems, especially SuSE ones, htpasswd is called as "htpasswd2"

====

----

htpasswd -b /opt/rudder/etc/htpasswd-webdav rudder $PASS

----

* Update the password in Rudder's system Techniques

----

cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques/system/common/1.0/
sed -i "s%^.*davpw.*$%   \"davpw\" string => \"$PASS\"\;%" site.st
git commit -m "Updated the rudder WebDAV access password" site.st

----

* Update the Rudder Directives by either reloading them in the web interface (in the "Configuration Management/Techniques" tab) or restarting jetty (NOT recommended)
