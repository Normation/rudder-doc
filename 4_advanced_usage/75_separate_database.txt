=== Use a database on a separate server

This section allows installing a separate database only without splitting the rest of the server components
like when using the rudder-multiserver-setup script. 
The setup is done in two places: on the database server and on the Rudder root server.

It also allows moving an existing database to another server.

==== On the database server

* Install and configure the agent on the node, and install the *rudder-reports* package.

* Change the `postgresql.conf` file (usually in `/var/lib/pgsql` or `/etc/postgresql`), to listen on the right interface to communicate with the server:

----

# you can use '*' to listen on all interfaces
listen_addresses = 'IP_TO_USE' 

----

* Also ensure that network policies (i.e. the firewall settings) allow PostgreSQL flows from the root server to the database server.

* Add an authorization line for the server (in `pg_hba.conf`, in the same directory):

----

host    rudder          rudder          ROOT_SERVER_IP/32       md5

----

* Restart postgresql to apply the new settings:

----

service postgresql restart

----

* Execute the following command to configure the password (that should be the same as RUDDER_PSQL_PASSWORD in `/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-passwords.conf` on the root server):

----

su - postgres -c "psql -c \"ALTER USER rudder WITH PASSWORD 'RUDDER_SERVER_DATABASE_PASSWORD'\""

----

* Run an inventory to the server:

----

rudder agent inventory

----

==== On the root server

In the following section, DATABASE_HOST refers to the hostname of the new database server, and SERVER_HOST to the hostname of
the root server.

* Remove the rudder-server-root and rudder-reports packages if installed. For example, you can run on Debian:

----

service rudder restart
apt-mark manual rudder-webapp rudder-inventory-endpoint
apt-get remove --purge rudder-reports

----

* You can also remove the postgresql package and database from the server if installed, but keep in mind you will lose all existing data.
You can follow the <<_migration_backups_and_restores, backup and restore>> procedure to migrate the data to the new database.

* Change the hostname in `/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties`:

----

rudder.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://DATABASE_HOST:5432/rudder

----

* Edit `/var/rudder/cfengine-community/inputs/rudder-server-roles.conf` and set the following line:

----

rudder-db:DATABASE_HOST

----

* Edit the /etc/rsyslog.d/rudder.conf file and change the hostname in:

----

:ompgsql:DATABASE_HOST,rudder,rudder,...

----

* Run an inventory:

----

rudder agent inventory

----

* Clear the cache (in Administration -> Settings)

* Restart rudder services: 

----

service rsyslog restart
service rudder restart

----

You should now have finished configuring the database server. You can check the technical logs to see if reports are correctly
written into the database and read by the web application.
