=== Technique creation

Rudder provides a set of pre-defined Techniques that cover some basic
configuration and system administration needs. You can also create your own
Techniques, to implement new functionality or configure new services. This
paragraph will walk you through this process.

==== Prequisites

To create a Technique, you'll need a few things:

CFEngine knowledge:: Rudder's Techniques are implemented using CFEngine.
Rudder takes care of a lot of the work of using CFEngine, but you'll need to
have a reasonable understanding of the CFEngine syntax.

Rudder installation for testing:: To be able to test your new Technique,
you'll need a working Rudder installation (at least a server and a node).

Text editor:: The only other tool you need is your favorite text editor!

==== Define your objective

Before starting to create a new Technique, have you checked that it doesn't
already exist in Rudder? The full list of current Techniques is available from
GitHub, at http:http://github.com/Normation/rudder-techniques/[GitHub rudder-techniques repository].

OK, now we've got that over with, let's go on.

A Technique should be an abstract configuration. This means that your Technique
shouldn't just configure something one way, but instead it should implement 
*how* to configure something, and offer options for users to choose what way
they want it configured. Before starting, make sure you've thought through what
you want to create.

Here's a quick checklist to help:

* Do you need to install packages?
* Do you need to create or edit configuration files?
* Do you need to copy files from a central location?
* Do you need to launch processes or check that they're running?
* Do you need to run commands to get things working?

Once you've made a list of what needs doing, consider what options could be
presented in the user interface, when you create a Directive from your new
Technique. Intuitively, the more variables there are, the more flexible your
Technique will be. However, experience shows that making the Technique *too*
configurable will actually make it harder to use, so a subtle balance comes in
to play here.

At this stage, make a list of all the variables that should be presented to
users configuring a Directive from your Technique.

==== Initialize your new Technique

The simplest way to create a new Technique and be able to test it as you work is
to start on a Rudder server. Open a terminal and connect to your Rudder server
by ssh, and cd into the directory where Techniques are stored:

----

$ cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques

----

Under this directory, you'll find a set of categories, and sub-categories.
Before creating your Technique, choose a category to put it in, and change to
that directory. For example:

----

$ cd applications

----

You can consult the description of each category by looking at the
+category.xml+ file in each directory. For this example:

----

$ cat category.xml
<xml>
    <name>Application management</name>
    <description>This category contains Techniques designed to install,
	configure and manage applications</description>
</xml>

----

Once you've decided on a category, it's time to create the basic skeleton of
your Technique. The technical name for your Technique is it's directory name, so
choose wisely:

----

mkdir sampleTechnique

----

All directories under this one are version numbers. Let's start with a simple
1.0 version. From now on, we'll work in this directory.

----

mkdir sampleTechnique/1.0
cd sampleTechnique/1.0

----

Now, you need a minimum of two files to get your Technique working:

metadata.xml:: This file describes the Technique, and configures how it will be
displayed in the web interface.

st files:: These files are templates for CFEngine configuration files. You need
at least one, but can have as many as you like. Rudder processes them to
generate .cf files ready to be used by CFEngine.

To get started, copy and paste these sample files, or download them from GitHub:

+metadata.xml+ (original file:
https://github.com/Normation/rudder-techniques/blob/master/technique-metadata-sample.xml[+technique-metadata-sample.xml+])

----

include::technique-metadata-sample.xml

----

+sample_technique.st+ (original file:
https://github.com/Normation/rudder-techniques/blob/master/technique-st-sample.xml[+technique-st-sample.xml+])

----

include::technique-st-sample.xml

----

===== Define variables

*WORK IN PROGRESS*
Define metadata.
Enter the variables in sections in the metadata.xml file.
Cf http://www.rudder-project.org/foswiki/Development/PolicyTemplateXML

===== First test in the Rudder interface

Load the new Technique into Rudder and check that the variables and sections are
displayed as you expect.

==== Implement the behavior

*WORK IN PROGRESS*
Write CFEngine promises to implement the behavior that your Template should
have.

===== Read in the variables from Rudder

*WORK IN PROGRESS*
Using StringTemplate notation...
Cf http://www.rudder-project.org/foswiki/Development/Technique

===== Add reporting

*WORK IN PROGRESS*
The reports format
