=== Node properties expansion in directives

It is possible to use properties defined on nodes to build Directive values. The
resulting values will be computed during policy generation, and can therefore
provide unique values for each node or be used in Javascript expression.

Properties on nodes are defined using Rudder REST API, using 'Update Node properties' api call.
More details in our http://www.rudder-project.org/rudder-api-doc[API documentation].

==== Feature availability

This feature was introduced in Rudder 3.1.14, Rudder 3.2.7 and Rudder 4.0.

If you upgraded to 3.1.14 (or a later 3.1.x version) or 3.2.7 (or a later 3.2.x
version) from a previous Rudder version, this feature is disabled by default
in order to mitigate any risk of undesired side effects on existing
installations. You can enable it in the Administration/Settings page, using the
*Enable node properties expansion in Directives* parameter.

Rudder installations from 4.0 onwards have this feature enabled by default.

==== Usage

In any directive text field, you can access property defined on nodes, with the following format:

----

${node.properties[keyone][keytwo]}

----


where:

- keyone, keytwo are path on json values
- the return value is the string representation, in compact mode, of the resulting access
- if the key is not found, we raise an error and stop the policy generation
- spaces are authorized around separators ([,],|,}..)

===== Providing a default value

Most of the time, you will need to provide a default value to node properties expansion to avoid a policy generation
error due to a missing node properties.
It's also a perfect to provide a simple specialisation of values for some nodes which have the property.

You can also use other node properties, or other rudder parameters has default.

Some examples:

----

${node.properties[datacenter][Europe] | "a simple value" }
${node.properties[datacenter][Europe] | """ a "value" with quotes""" }
${node.properties[datacenter][Europe] | ${rudder.param.some_value} }
${node.properties[datacenter][Europe] | ${rudder.node.hostname}
${node.properties[datacenter][Europe] | ${node.properties[other_on_node] | node }
${node.properties[datacenter][Europe] |${node.properties[other] | "some value ${rudder.node.id}" }

----


===== Requesting expansion on the node

In some cases, you will want to use a `${node.properties[key]}` in a directive parameter, but you don't want to expand it during
policy generation, and let the value expanded during the agent run on the node. Typically if the value is to be used by a templating
tool, or if the value is known only on the node.

For these cases, you can add the option "node" to the properties expression:

----

${node.properties[datacenter][Europe] | node }

----

This will be rewritten during policy generation into:

----

${node.properties[datacenter][Europe]}

----

Which will be treated as a variable by the agent (replace by its value if defined, kept as is if unknown).

The variable is content is read from /var/rudder/cfengine-community/inputs/properties.d/properties.json.
