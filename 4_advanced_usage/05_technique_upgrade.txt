=== About Technique upgrades

==== Initial installation

At the first installation, Rudder will automatically deploy a Technique library in the
/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques directory.

==== Upgrade

When upgrading Rudder to another version, a new (updated) Technique library will be deployed
in /opt/rudder/share/techniques, and Rudder will automatically take care of updating the system
Techniques in the configuration-repository directory.

However, the other Techniques will not be updated automatically (yet), so you will have to do
it yourself.

[CAUTION]

====

Please keep in mind that if you did manual modifications on the Techniques in existing directories,
or created new versions of them, you will have some merging work to make.

===== Upgrading the Technique library

----

root@node:~# cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository
root@node:~# cp -a /opt/rudder/share/techniques/* techniques/
root@node:~# git status
#Â Now, inspect the differences. If no conflicts is noticeables, then go ahead.
root@node:~# git add techniques/
root@node:~# git commit -m "Technique upgrade" # Here, put a meaningful message about why you are updating.

----

After the commit has been validated by GIT, please go to the Rudder web interface, to the Administration tab,
Policy Server tab, and click on "Reload Techniques". It will reload the Technique library and trigger a full
redeployment on nodes.

Please check that the deployment is successful before logging out.
