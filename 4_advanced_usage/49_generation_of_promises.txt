=== Generation of CFEngine promises

Each time a change occurs in the Rudder interface, having an impact on the
CFEngine promises needed by a node, it is necessary to regenerate the modified
promises for every impacted node. By default this process is launched after each
change.

==== +Regenerate now+ button

The button +Regenerate now+ on the top right of the screen permit you to force
the regeneration of the promises. As changes in the inventory of the nodes are
not automatically taken into account by Rudder, this feature can be usefull
after some changes impacting the inventory informations.

==== Disable automatic regeneration of promises

In certain circumstances, it can be necessary to disable the automatic
regeneration of the promises. It can be done by setting following property to
false in +/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties+.

----

rudder.autoDeployOnModification=true

----

When switching to manual deployment of promises, the presence of pending changes
is advertised on top of the +Regenerate now+ button. Each modification can be
reviewed before validation.
