=== User management

Change the users authorized to connect to the application.
You can define authorization level for each user

==== Configuration of the users using a XML file

===== Generality and uses of clear text password

The credentials of a user are defined in the XML file
+/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-users.xml+. This file expects the following format:

----

<authentication>
  <user name="jon.doe" password="secret" role="administator"/>
  <user name="alex.bar" password="secret2" role="administation_only, node_read"/>
  <user name="custom" password="custom" role="node_read,node_write,configuration_read,rule_read,rule_edit,directive_read,technique_read"
</authentication>

----

The name and password attributes are mandatory (non empty) for the user tags.
The role attribute can be ommited but the user will have no permission.
Only these attributes are recognized.

Every modification of this file should be followed by a restart of the Rudder
web application to be taken into account:

----

/etc/init.d/jetty restart

----

===== Use of hashed passwords

The authentication tag may have the hash attribute. If defined, the password
will be stored as hashes.

The algorithm used to create the hash (and verify it during authentication)
depend on the value of the hash attribute. The possible values, the
corresponding algorithm and the Linux shell command need to obtain the hash of
the "secret" password for this algorithm are listed here:

[options="header"]

|====
|Value                 | Algorithm      | Linux command to hash the password
|"md5"                 | MD5            | +read mypass; echo -n $mypass \| md5sum+
|"sha" or "sha1"       | SHA one        | +read mypass; echo -n $mypass \| shasum+
|"sha256" or "sha-256" | SHA, 256 bytes | +read mypass; echo -n $mypass \| sha256sum+
|"sha512" or "sha-512" | SHA, 512 bytes | +read mypass; echo -n $mypass \| sha512sum+
|"LDAP" | none | Requires that you validate the LDAP configuration. See point 10.2.4
|====

When using the suggested commands to hash a password, you must enter the
command, then type your password, and hit return. The hash will then be
displayed in your terminal. This avoids storing the password in your shell
history.

Here is an example of authentication file with hashed password:

----

<authentication hash="sha">
  <user name="jon.doe"  password="e5e9fa1ba31ecd1ae84f75caaa474f3a663f05f4" role="administator"/>
  <user name="alex.bar" password="c636e8e238fd7af97e2e500f8c6f0f4c0bedafb0" role="administation_only"/>
</authentication>

==== Authorization management

For every user you can define an access level.
Those authorizations allow you to access different pages or to perform different actions.

You can build custom roles with whatever permission you want, but there's some role already defined.

In the xml file, the role attribute is a list of permissions/roles, separated by a comma. Each adds permissions to the user. If one is wrong, or not correctly spelled, the user is set to the lowest rights (NoRights).

===== Pre-defined roles

* administrator -> All authorizations granted, can access and modify everything.
* administration_only -> Only access to administration part of rudder, can do everything within it.
* user -> Can access and modify eveything but the administration part
* configuration -> Can only access and act on configuration section
* read_only -> Can access to every read only part, can perform no action
* inventory -> Access to information about nodes, can see their inventory, but can't act on them
* rule_only -> Access to information about rules, but can't modify them

for each user you can define more than one role, each role adding its authorization to the user.

===== Permissions and custom roles

You can set a custom set of permissions instead of a pre-defined role.

A permission is composed of a kind and a type.

A permission kind is the level granted for a certain type. There's 4 kinds of permission : read, write, edit, all. Depending on that value you have access to different pages and action in rudder.

There's 8 type of permission : configuration, rule, directive, technique, node, group, administration, deployment. that value indicates what kind of datas will be displayed and/or could be set/updated by the user, depending of his access level.

==== Going further

Rudder aims at integrating with your IT system transparently, so it can't force
its own authentication system.

To meet this need, Rudder relies on the modular authentication system Spring
Security that allows to easily integrate with databases, LDAP directory, or an
entreprise SSO like CAS, OpenID or SPNEGO. The documentation for this
integration is not yet available, but don't hesitate to reach us on this topic.
