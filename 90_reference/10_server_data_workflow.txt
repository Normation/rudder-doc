=== Rudder Server data workflow

To have a better understanding of the Archive feature of Rudder, a description
of the data workflow can be useful.

All the logic of Rudder Techniques is stored on the filesystem in
+/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques+. 
The files are under version control, using git.
The tree is organized as following: 

. At the first level, techniques are classified in categories: applications,
fileConfiguration, fileDistribution,  jobScheduling,  system,  systemSettings.
The description of the category is included in +category.xml+.

. At the second and third level, Technique identifier and version.

. At the last level, each technique is described with a +metadata.xml+ file and
one or several CFEngine template files (name ending with +.st+).

----

At Rudder Server startup, or after the user has requested a reload of the
Rudder Techniques, each +metadata.xml+ is mapped in memory, and used to create
the LDAP subtree of Active Techniques.
The LDAP tree contains also a set of subtrees for Node Groups, Rules and Node
Configurations.

At each change of the Node Configurations, Rudder Server creates CFEngine draft policies
(+Cf3PolicyDraft+) that are stored in memory, and then invokes +cf-clerk+. 
+cf-clerk+ finally generates the CFEngine promises for the Nodes.
