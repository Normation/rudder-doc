=== Package format

Rudder has a specific package format for plugins.

You can manage Rudder packages with the rudder-pkg command. This is the documentation of how they are created.

==== File description

A Rudder package file ends with the `.rpkg` extension.

A Rudder package file is an archive file and can be managed with the 'ar' command.

The archive contains:

* A metadata file in JSON format named medatata
* A tarball file in txz format name scripts.txz that contains package setup utility scripts
* One or more tarball files in txz format that contain the package files

The metadata file is a JSON file and is named 'metadata':

  "type": "plugin",
  # the package name must consist of ascii characters without whitespace (mandatory)
  "name": "myplugin",

To see a package metadata file use:

----

ar p package.rpkg medatada

----

The scripts.txz is a tarball that can contain zero or more executable files named:

* preinst that will be run before installing the package files 
* postinst that will be run after installing the package files
* prerm that will be run before removing the package files
* postrm that will be run after removing the package files

preinst and postinst take one parameter that can be 'install' or 'upgrade'. The value 'upgrade' is used when a previous version of the package is already installed.

To create the scripts.txz file use:

----

tar cvfJ scripts.txz preinst postinst prerm postrm

----

To create a Rudder package file use the ar command:

----

ar r mypackage-4.1-3.0.rpkg medatada scripts.txz files.txz

----

Note that ar r inserts or replaces files so you can create your package with incremental inserts.

To extract files, 'use ar x' instead.
