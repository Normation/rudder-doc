=== Syntax of the Techniques

==== Generalities

The Techniques use the http://www.stringtemplate.org/[StringTemplate] engine. A Technique *must* have the .st extension to be extended by Rudder (have some variables replaced, some part removed or added given some parameters).

==== Variable remplacement

Note : Rudder use a StringTemplate grammar slighlty different from the default one. Rather than using "$" as a variable identifier, the Techniques use "&" to avoid collision with the CFEngine variables

===== Single-valued variable remplacement

----

&UUID&

----

   * Will be remplaced by the value of the variable UUID

===== Remplacement of variable with one or more values

----

&DNS_RESOLVERS: { "&it&" };separator=", "&

----

   * Will be remplaced by `"8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"`
   * Here, `&it&` is an alias for the current item in the list (with no confusion, because there is only one variable)

----

&POLICYCHILDREN, CHILDRENID : {host, uuid |
"/var/rudder/share/&uuid&/"
maproot => { host2ip("&host&"), escape("&host&") },
admit => { host2ip("&host&"), escape("&host&") };
   
} &

----

   * `host` is an alias for the current value of POLICYCHILDREN
   * `uuid` is an alias for the current value of CHILDRENID
   * Both item are iterated at the same time, so both list must have the same length

===== Remplacement of variable with one or more value, and writing an index all along

----

&FILE_AND_FOLDER_MANAGEMENT_PATH:{path |"file[&i&][path]" string => "&path&";
}&

----

   * _i_ is an iterator, starting at 1

The result would be:

----

"file[1][path]" string => "/var";
"file[2][path]" string => "/bin";

----

===== Conditionnal writing of a section

----

&if(INITIAL)&

something

&endif&

----

The variable must either be:

   * A boolean: If its value is true, then the section will be displayed
   * A variable with the parameter `MAYBEEMPTY="true"`: If the value is not set, then the section won't be displayed, otherwise it will be displayed
