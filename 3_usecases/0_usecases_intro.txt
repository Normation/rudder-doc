== Usecases

This chapter gives a few examples for using Rudder. We have no doubt that you'll
have your own ideas, that we're impatient to hear about...

=== Dynamic groups by operating system

Create dynamic groups for each operating system you administer, so that you can
apply specific policies to each type of OS. When new nodes are added to Rudder,
these policies will automatically be enforced upon them.

=== Library of preventive policies

Why not create policies for emergency situations in advance? You can then put
your IT infrastructure in "panic" mode in just a few clicks.

For example, using the provided Techniques, you could create a Name
resolution Directive to use your own internal DNS servers for normal situations,
and a second, alternative Directive, to use Google's public DNS servers, in case
your internal DNS servers are no longer available.

=== Standardizing configurations

You certainly have your own best practices (let's call them good habits) for
setting up your SSH servers.

But is that configuration the same on all your servers? Enforce the settings
your really want using an OpenSSH server policy and apply it to all your Linux
servers. SSH servers can then be stopped or reconfigured manually many times,
Rudder will always restore your preferred settings and restart the SSH server in
less than 5 minutes.
