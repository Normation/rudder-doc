[[dsc-agent-installation]]
=== Install Windows DSC agent

The installation and upgrade processes are exactly the same.
The Rudder agent needs *PowerShell 4* or later to be functionnal, which is built-in on:

 * Windows Server 2012 R2 and later

And Available on:

 * Windows Server 2008 R2
 * Windows Server 2012

Rudder does not currently support officialy the desktop versions of Microsoft Windows.

Download the *exe* file, and run, on your node:

----

rudder-agent-dsc-<Rudder version>-<plugin version>.exe	

----

The installer will ask you the IP address of the policy server to use.
If a policy server is already configured (for example during upgrade), you can leave this field empty.

The installer will install the agent files and create the scheduled
tasks to run the agent and the inventory. Rudder does not come as a Windows Service but as a scheduled
PowerShell task, managed by *schtasks.exe*.

If you want to do an automated unattended installation, you can re-configure the policy server in:

----
C:\Program Files\Rudder\etc\policy-server.conf
----

Before running the installer with:

----

rudder-agent-dsc-<Rudder version>-<plugin version>.exe \S

----

This will install the agent without asking questions.
