==== Rudder functions

Rudder addresses two main functions:

. Configuration management;

. Asset management;

The configuration management function relies on the asset management function.
The purpose of the asset management function is to identify Nodes and some of
their characteristics which can be useful to perform configuration management.
The purpose of configuration management is to apply rules on Nodes. A rule can
include the installation of a tool, the configuration of a service, the
execution of a daemon, etc. To apply rules on Nodes, Rudder uses the
information produced by the asset management function to identify these Nodes
and evaluate some specific information about them.
