=== What is Rudder?

Rudder is an easy to use, web-driven, role-based solution for IT Infrastructure
Automation and Compliance. With a focus on continuously checking configurations
and centralising real-time status data, Rudder can show a high-level summary
(_ISO 27001 rules are at 100%!_) and break down noncompliance issues to a deep
technical level (_Host prod-web-03: SSH server configuration allows root logins_).

A few things that make Rudder stand out:

* A *simple framework* allows you to *extend the built-in rules* to implement
  specific low-level configuration patterns, however complex they may be, using
  simple building blocks (_ensure package installed in version X_, _ensure file content_,
  _ensure line in file_, etc.). A graphical builder lowers the technical level required to use this.
* Each policy can be independently set to be automatically *checked or enforced*
  on a policy or host level. In Enforce mode, each remediation action is recorded,
  showing the value of these invisible fixes.
* Rudder works on almost *every kind of device*, so you’ll be managing physical
  and virtual servers in the data center, cloud instances, and embedded IoT devices
  in the same way.
* Rudder is designed for *critical environments* where a *security* breach can mean
  more than a blip in the sales stats. Built-in features include change requests,
  audit logs, and strong authentication.
* Rudder relies on an agent that needs to be installed on all hosts to audit.
  The *agent is very lightweight* (10 to 20 MB of RAM at peak) and *blazingly fast*
  (it’s written in C and takes less than 10 seconds to verify 100 rules). Installation
  is self-contained, via a single package, and can auto-update to limit agent
  management burden.
* Rudder is a *true and professional open source* solution—the team behind Rudder
  doesn’t believe in the dual-speed licensing approach that makes you reinstall
  everything and promotes open source as little more than a “demo version.”

Rudder is an established project with *several 10000s of node managed*, in companies
from small to biggest-in-their-field. Typical deployments manage 100s to 1000s of nodes.
The biggest known deployment in 2017 is about 7000 nodes.

==== Made for production environments

We believe that there is a growing impedence mismatch between the Short Time of
application development and deployement, and the Long Time of the infrastructure.
The latter need rationalisation, stability and conformity before catching the hyped
techno of the day, to be able to deliver reliable technical platform, continuously
working with a minimum of risks.

Rudder was made for the Long Time, to help team deliver efficient infrastructures with
simplicity, giving them feedback where needed, keeping them alert of possible
incoming problem, continously checking conformity to their rules, and all of that
whatever the infrastructure they choose to build.

To achieve these goals, Rudder goes beyond simple automation of commands or
configurations. Rudder continuously maintains your infrastructure to keep it
conform with your configurations and security rules.

At each level (global, by configuration policy, by node, etc), you can choose to
either *Audit* the component - and no modification at all will made on it -, or to
*Enforce* the policy, automatically correcting a drift if needed.

==== Different roles for a better accessibility

Rudder was thought from the start for plug&play-ability: easy to install and to
upgrade, easy to start with and growth with.

Rudder comes with a graphical interface, a standard library of configuration
policy ready to use, and a graphical rule editor.

Developers can script Rudder through its APIs and security teams can check
conformity level to their policies or inventory (both software and hardware) of a
server at any time.


==== Universality

Rudder agent is extremely fast, light, and versatile. It works on a wide variety
of OS or hardware, from physical server to cloud instance, user laptops or even
Digital Cities and IoT objects.
