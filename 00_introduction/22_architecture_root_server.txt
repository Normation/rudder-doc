[[Server_supported_OS, the list of supported Operating Systems for Root server]]

=== Specifications for Rudder Root Server

==== Hardware specifications

A dedicated server is strongly recommended.

Your Rudder Root Server can be either a physical or a virtual machine. 

At least 1024 MB of RAM must be available on the server, depending on the
base requirements of your operating system.

Rudder Server is running on both 32 and 64 bit versions of every supported
Operating System. 

==== Supported Operating Systems

The following operating systems are supported as a Root server:

* Debian GNU/Linux 5 (Lenny)

* Debian GNU/Linux 6 (Squeeze)

* SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 11 SP1

[WARNING]

.Unsupported Operating Systems

====

Installing Rudder Servers on other operating systems is planned, but has not
been tested with the current version.

====

==== Packages

Rudder components are distributed as a set of packages.

.Rudder packages and their dependancies

----

include::../graphviz/packages.dot[]

----

+rudder-webapp+::

Package for the Rudder Web Application. It is the graphical interface for
Rudder.

+rudder-inventory-endpoint+::

Package for the inventory reception service. It has no graphical interface. This
service is using HTTP as transport protocol. It receives an parses the files
sent by FusionInventory and insert the valuable data into the LDAP database.

+rudder-jetty+::

Application server for +rudder-webapp+ and +rudder-inventory-endpoint+. Both
packages are written in 'Scala'. At compilation time, they are converted into
+.war+ files. They need to be run in an application server. 'Jetty' is this
application server. It depends on 'Oracle Java JRE'.

+rudder-policy-templates+::

Package for the Policy Templates. They are installed in
+/opt/rudder/share/policy-templates+. At runtime, the Policy Templates are
copied into a 'git' repository in +/var/rudder+. Therefore, the package depends
on the +git+ package.

+rudder-inventory-ldap+::

Package for the database containing the inventory and configuration informations
for each pending and validated Nodes. This 'LDAP' database is build upon
'OpenLDAP' server.  The 'OpenLDAP' engine is contained in the package.

+rudder-reports+::

Package for the database containing the logs sent by each Node and the reports
computed by Rudder. This is a 'PostgreSQL' database using the 'PostgreSQL'
engine of the distribution. The package has a dependancy on the +postgresl+
package, creates the database named +rudder+ and installs the inialisation
scripts for that database in +/opt/rudder/etc/postgresql/*.sql+.

+rudder-cfengine-community+::

Package for the CFEngine server. This server delivers to the Nodes the Applied
Policies converted into CFEngine promises.

+rudder-server-root+::

Package to ease installation of every Rudder services. This package depends on
all above packages. It also 

- installs the Rudder configuration script:

----

/opt/rudder/bin/rudder-init.sh

----

- installs the initial promises for the Root Server in:

----

/opt/rudder/share/initial-promises/

----

- installs the init scripts (and associated +default+ file):

----

/etc/init.d/rudder-server-root

----

- installs the logrotate configuration:

----

/etc/logrotate.d/rudder-server-root

----

+rudder-agent+::

One single package integrates everything needed for the Rudder Agent. It
contains CFEngine Commmunity, FusionInventory, and the initial promises for a
Node. It also contains an init script:

----

/etc/init.d/rudder-agent 

----

The +rudder-agent+ package depends on a few common libraries and utilities:

* +OpenSSL+
* +libpcre+
* +libdb+ (4.6 on Debian)
* +uuidgen+ (utility from +uuid-runtime package+ on Debian)


==== Software dependencies and third party components

The Rudder Web application requires the installation of 'Apache 2 httpd',
'Oracle Java 6 JRE', and 'cURL'; the LDAP Inventory service needs 'rsyslog' and
the report service requires 'PostgreSQL'.

When available, packages from your distribution are used. These packages are:

Apache::

The Apache Web server is used as a proxy to give HTTP access to the Web
Application. It is also used to give writable WebDAV access for the inventory.
The Nodes send their inventory to the WebDAV service, the inventory is stored in
+/var/rudder/inventories/incoming+.

PostgreSQL::

The PostgreSQL database is used to store logs sent by the Nodes and reports
generated by Rudder.

rsyslog and rsyslog-pgsql::

The rsyslog server is receiving the logs from the nodes and insert them into a
PostgreSQL database. On SLES, the +rsyslog-pgsql+ package is not part of the
distribution, it can be downloaded alongside Rudder packages.

Oracle Java JRE::

The Java runtime is needed by the Jetty application server. On Debian, the
package from the distribution is used. On SLES, the package must be dowloaded
from Oracle website.

curl::

This package is used to send inventory files from
+/var/rudder/inventories/incoming+ to the Rudder Endpoint.

git::

The package is not a dependency, but its installation is recommended. The
running Policy Templates Library is maintained as a git repository in
+/var/rudder/policy-templates+. It can be useful to have git installed on the
system for maintenance purpose.
