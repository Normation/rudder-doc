=== Specifications for Rudder Root Server

==== Hardware specifications and sizing

A dedicated server is strongly recommended, either physical or virtual with at least one dedicated core.
Rudder Server runs on both 32 (if available) and 64 bit versions of every supported Operating System.

===== Memory

The required amount of RAM mainly depends on the number of managed nodes. A general rule for the minimal value is:

* less than 50 nodes: 2GB
* between 50 and 1000 nodes: 4GB
* more than 1000 nodes: 4GB + 1GB of RAM by 500 nodes above 1000.

When managing more than 1000 nodes, we also recommend you to use a multiserver
installation for Rudder as described in chapter <<multiserver-rudder, Multiserver Rudder>>.

For large installations, you should also tune the amount of RAM given to:

* the web application, as explained in the section
<<_configure_ram_allocated_to_jetty, about webapplication RAM configuration>> 
* PostgresSQL, as explained in the <<_optimize_postgresql_server, Optimize PostgreSQL Server>> section

===== Disk

The PostgresSQL database is the main storage user. The disk space 
necessary for the database can be estimated by counting around
150 to 400kB of storage used by Directive, by Node and by day of storage of node's
execution reports (default to 30 days):

----
max_space = number of Directives * number of Nodes * retention duration in days * 400 kB
----

For example, an installation managing 150 nodes, with an average of 
100 Directives by node, and keeping execution reports for one week 
should anticipate the use of between 20GB and 60GB of disk size for PostgreSQL. 

You can follow the <<_reports_retention, Reports Retention>> section to configure the
retention duration.

==== Supported Operating Systems

The following operating systems are supported as a Root server:

GNU/Linux:

* Debian 7 and 8

* RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) / RHEL-like 6 and 7

* SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 11 SP1 and SP3

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise), 14.04 LTS (Trusty)
