=== Policy Server

The *Administration > Policy Server Management* section sum-up information about
Rudder policy server and its parameters. 

==== Configure allowed networks

Here you can configure the networks from which nodes are allowed to connect to
Rudder policy server to get their updated rules.

You can add as many networks as you want, the expected format is:
+networkip/mask+, for example +42.42.0.0/16+. 

==== Clear caches

Clear cached data, like node configuration. That will trigger a full
redeployment, with regeneration of all promises files.

==== Reload dynamic groups

Reload dynamic groups, so that new nodes and their inventories are taken into
account. Normally, dynamic group are automatically reloaded unless that feature
is explicitly disable in Rudder configuration file.
