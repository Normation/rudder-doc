=== Technique upgrade

New versions of the Technique library are made available as packages,
named rudder-policy-templates, for the 2.3 version of Rudder. Many bug fixes
and new Techniques are added all the time. To benefit from these, we
recommend you upgrade your Technique library from time to time.

Updates are available from rudder-project.org, as standard OS package
downloads. Please note that nightly builds are also available, and may provide
the most up to date set of Techniques. See
http://www.rudder-project.org/foswiki/Download/ for full details.

When you upgrade the Rudder Techniques packages to a new version, a
new version of the Technique library is copied to /opt/rudder/share/techniques.

The Technique library is managed using a GIT tree,
located in /var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques.
Thus, you can not simply copy the files from /opt/rudder/share/techniques to Rudder's
storage, you also have to follow this simple procedure:

[TIP] 

====

Please make sure that any changes you make are on a new version of a Technique,
or you are likely to have your changes replaced by the reference implementation!
Of course, GIT will keep history if your modifications are already committed but this would be
an annoyance.

====

* Copy the reference Technique library to your local tree

----

cp -a /opt/rudder/share/techniques/* /var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques/

----

* Update the GIT repository to match the new tree state

----

cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques
git add .
git commit -m "Upgraded the Technique library (by $USER)"

----

* Finally, return to the web interface and go the Configuration Management
  menu, then click on the Techniques menu item on the left. In the
  screen that appears, click the "Reload" button next to "You can load the
  last available version of the Technique library" at the top of the
  screen.
