=== Node properties

Node properties can be found in the "properties" tab of each node in Rudder.

Node properties can be modified using Rudder's API, see http://www.rudder-project.org/rudder-api-doc/#api-Nodes-updateNodeProperties

Properties can also be defined on the node itself, to override locally properties.

Each property is a key=value pair. The value can be a string or a well-formatted JSON data structure.

Some examples:
`datacenter=Paris`
`datacenter= { "id": "FRA1", "name": "Colo 1, Paris", "location": "Paris, France", "dns_suffix": "paris.example.com" }`


==== Using properties

You can use node properties almost everywhere in Rudder:

* in directive parameters
* in the technique editor
* in your own techniques and generic methods

To use a property, simply use the variable node.properties with the variable call syntax.

Example with a property named 'datacenter':

----

${node.properties[datacenter]}

----

WARNING: Before Rudder 3.1.14 and 3.2.7, node properties could not be used in JavaScript expressions (see following section), since they are evaluated during policy generation and node properties were only made available to agents at runtime. Since Rudder 3.1.14, 3.2.7 and 4.0.0 and later, you can enable a feature switch in "Administration/Settings" to enable node properties expansion in directive parameters. More details are available at <<_node_properties_expansion_in_directives>>.

In a mustache template, use:

----

{{{vars.node.properties.datacenter}}}

----

==== Local override

The agent searches for optionnal properties files `/var/rudder/local/properties.d/*.json`, and will override existing properties.

As a result, if you have node properties defined server side as
`"sysctls_postgresql":{"kernel.shmall":"903330","kernel.shmmax":"3700041320"}` and
`"vm":{"vm.dirty_ratio":"10"}`

and a local property file `/var/rudder/local/properties.d/postgresql_config.json` as

----

{ 
  "properties": 
  {
    "sysctls_postgresql": {
      "kernel.shmmax":"5368709120"
    }
  }
}

----

The resulting properties will be:

`"sysctls_postgresql":{"kernel.shmmax":"5368709120"}` and
`"vm":{"vm.dirty_ratio":"10"}`

`sysctls_postgresql` has been overriden by local property, and `vm` has been left untouched


==== Under the hood

On the server, one or more properties files are written for each node in the
`/var/rudder/share/<uuid>/rules/cfengine-community/properties.d/` directory.
This directory is then copied to each node by the agent with all other promise files.

In the agent, properties are made available in the `node.<namespace>` container that contains the values.
Those values are read from
`/var/rudder/cfengine-community/inputs/properties/*.json`. All files are taken
in order and override the previous ones - the last one wins.

The agent searches for optionnal properties files `/var/rudder/local/properties.d/*.json`, and will define variables
or override existing properties.

Each file must contain at least 2 levels of JSON content, the first level is the namespace level
and the second level is the key level.

The namespace name must be an ASCII name that doesn't start with `_` and must
match the following regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`

For example: 

----

{ 
  "properties": 
  {
    "datacenter": "Paris",
    "environment": "production",
    "customer": "Normation"
  }
}

----

The merge is a first level merge done at the namespace level. This means that:

* a key in a namespace is fully overridden by the same key in the same namespace in a later file.
* a key in a namespace is never overriden by the same key in a different namespace
* a key that is overriden never retains original data even if it is a data container itself

The result key is available in the `node.<namespace>` data variable. A usage
example:

----
${node.properties[datacenter]}
----

To get the original data (for debug only) there is the
`properties.property_<fileid>` variable. A usage example:

----
${properties.property__var_rudder_cfengine_community_inputs_properties_d_properties_json[properties][datacenter]}
----
