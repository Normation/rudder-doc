=== Units supported as search parameters

Some parameters for the advanced search tool allow using units. For example, in
the search criterion for RAM size, you can type +512MB+ instead of a value in
bytes. This paragraph describes supported units by parameter type.

==== Bytes and multiples

All criteria using a memory size (RAM, hard disk capacity, etc) is by default
expected in bytes. If no other unit is specified, all values will be assumed to
be in bytes.

==== Convenience notation

All memory sizes can be written using spaces or underscores (+_+) to make the
numbers easier to read. Numbers must begin with a digit. For example, the
following numbers are all valid and all worth +1234+:

----

1234
1 234
1_234
1234_

----

The following number is not valid:

----

_1234

----

==== Supported units

Units used are non binary units, and a multiplication factor of 1024 is applied
between each unit. Units are case-insensitive. Therefore, +Mb+ is identical to
+mB+ or +mb+ or +MB+.

In detail, the following units are supported (provided in lower case, see
above):
