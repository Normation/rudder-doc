=== Extending Rudder with plugins

Rudder can be extended with Plugins so that new features or API endpoints are
available in Rudder web application.

==== Rudder Plugin

A plugin is an archive in the `.rpkg` file format that can be manipulated with the
`rudder-pkg` command (see <<rpkg_plugin_management, Plugins Administration>>)

A Rudder plugin has full access to all Rudder internal APIs, datas, and process.
Its power is very large, but some care must be taken to ensure that the plugin
does not break Rudder main use cases.
That is why we prefer to build smaller plugin, adding only one feature, and
doing it in the least impacting way.

Here come a list of some plugin so that one can grasp the kind of feature that a
plugin can bring to Rudder:

===== Extending API: rudder-plugin-itop

Link: https://github.com/normation/rudder-plugin-itop

This plugin was used to add new API endpoint dedicated to the integration with
https://www.combodo.com/itop-193[iTop CMDB software].

As of Rudder 4.0, the plugin is superseeded by Rudder Compliance API.

===== Adding information to node details: rudder-plugin-external-node-information

Link: https://github.com/normation/rudder-plugin-external-node-information

This plugin allows to add new tabs in Rudder "node details" page and display
node specific files, stored in node-dedicated places. It also use a
self-managed and hot-reloading configuration of its properties.

===== Providing new authentication methods

Rudder plugins can be used to provide new authentication methods. There is no
open source version of such module, but at least a Radius Authentication Plugin
exists.

===== Providing a full new feature: rudder-plugin-datasources

Link: https://github.com/normation/rudder-plugin-datasources

As we said, Rudder plugins can be quite powerful. For example, the "Data sources
Plugin" brings a completely new feature to Rudder by allowing to configure external
API data sources from which Rudder will get node properties. The plugin set-up
its own data base table, comes with its own UI (available in Rudder "administration"
page), and interacts with node properties.


==== Building your own plugins

As of Rudder 4.1, there is no dedicated, frozen plugin API for plugins. A plugin
is built in Scala, and the normal starting point is to clone and study the
template plugin project,
https://github.com/normation/rudder-plugin-helloworld[rudder-plugin-helloworld].

The project code source is documented to be didactic and provides:

- an example of the packaging resources needed to build a ".rpkg" package,
- example of configuration file for the plugin,
- plugin definition and plugin registration when Rudder starts,
- how to interact with Rudder internal services,
- how to define new APIs.

Of course, you can look to the other open source plugins listed above to get
other, more involved example about how to do things.

You also can interact with Rudder developpers throught the
https://www.rudder-project.org/site/community/mailing-lists/[community] regular
communication channels.
