=== Rudder integration in your infrastructure

The other mains way to integrate Rudder into an existing infrastructure is
by making existing process or software take advantage of Rudder.

==== Existing third party integration

==== Rundeck

http://rundeck.org[Rundeck] is a tool that helps automating infrastructures, by
defining jobs that can be run manually or automatically. There is a
https://github.com/Normation/rundeck-plugin-rudder[plugin] for Rundeck
that allows using Rudder inventory data in Rundeck.

With that plugin, you can execute commands on node registered in Rudder, taking
advantage of the groups defined for you policies.

==== Ansible

There is an https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/contrib/inventory/rudder.py[inventory plugin]
for Ansible that makes possible to use Rudder inventory (including groups, nodes,
group ids, node ids, and node properties) as inventory for Ansible, for example
for orchestration tasks on your platform.
It is part of Ansible as of version 2.0.

===== iTop

https://www.combodo.com/itop-193[iTop] is an Open Source CMDB solution. It allows
to describe you IT services and analyse impact of problems.

There is a prototype integration of iTop and Rudder which allows iTop to Rudder
as a source of information about the server content (inventory) and current
compliance level. With that integration, you can see in real time in your CMDB when
a server managed by Rudder is drifting away from its expecting configuration, and
use iTop to understand the impact of such a drift for your IT services.

==== Integrate Rudder thanks to its APIs

All the above plugins are using http://www.rudder-project.org/rudder-api-doc/[Rudder APIs]
under the hood to operate or get data from Rudders. Rudder APIs are as powerful
as the UI, and anything that can be done throught the main graphical interface
can also be scripted away with the APIs.

The documentation provided on APIs is exhaustive, but here comes a summary of
what can be done with them:

- accept, delete a node and manage its parameters,
- get information with a parametrable depth about node inventories,
- search for nodes,
- manage (create, update, delete) groups, directives, rules and parameters,
- interact with the Techniques library,
- get compliance details about a node or a rule, with a parameterized depth of
  information,
- manage change requests.

And of course, any plugin can provide new API endpoints, as is doing the
data source plugin.

These API can also be used to automate Rudder action, like node acceptation or compliance
export and archiving for nodes.
