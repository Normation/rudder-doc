== Upgrade Rudder

This short chapter covers the upgrade of the Rudder Server Root and Rudder Agent
from olders versions to the latest version, 2.8.

Please note that you can upgrade directly from Rudder 2.4.x, 2.6.x or 2.7.x to
Rudder 2.8. However, upgrades from 2.3.x and 2.5.x are no longer supported.
If you are still running 2.3.x or 2.5.x, please first upgrade to one of
the supported versions above.

The upgrade is quite similar to the installation.

A big effort has been made to ensure that all upgrade steps are performed
automatically by packaging scripts. Therefore, you shouldn't have to do any
upgrade procedures manually, but you will note that several data migrations
occur during the upgrade process.
