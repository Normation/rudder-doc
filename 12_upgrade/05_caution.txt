=== Upgrade notes

==== Upgrade from Rudder 3.0 or older

Direct upgrades from 3.0.x and older are no longer supported on 4.1.
If you are still running one of those, either on servers or nodes,
please first upgrade to one of the supported versions above, and then upgrade to 4.1.

==== Upgrade from Rudder 3.1, 3.2 or 4.0

Migration from 3.1, 3.2 or 4.0 are supported, so you can upgrade directly to 4.1.

[WARNING]

====

In Rudder 4.0, we changed the default communication protocol between agent and server,
but still stay compatible with the old protocol. Hence, you can perfectly keep using
pre-4.0 agents with a 4.0 or 4.1 server.

However, some networking issues may appear when using 4.0 or 4.1 agents with older servers with the
reverse DNS lookup option disabled in the settings (*Security* ->
*Use reverse DNS lookups on nodes to reinforce authentication to policy server*).

Therefore, you need to upgrade your server to 4.1 *before* upgrading the nodes so that the
configuration distributed to the nodes include the use of the new protocol.

==== Compatibility between Rudder agent 4.1 and older server versions

===== 4.0.x servers

Rudder agents 4.1.x are compatible with 4.0 Rudder servers.

===== 3.1.x and 3.2.x servers

Rudder agents 4.1.x are not compatible with Rudder servers older than 4.0.0.
You need to upgrade your server to 4.1 before the agents.

==== Compatibility between Rudder server 4.1 and older agent versions

===== 4.0.x agents

Rudder agent 4.0.x are fully compatible with Rudder server 4.1.x. It is
therefore not strictly necessary to update your agents to 4.1.x.

===== 3.1.x and 3.2.x agents

Rudder agent 3.1.x and 3.2.x are compatible with Rudder server 4.1.x, but they
do not support the new "Audit" policy mode. It is therefore not strictly
necessary to update your agents to 4.0.x, unless you want to be able to use
the "Audit" policy mode.

===== 3.0.x or older

These agents are not compatible with Rudder 4.1, and you have to upgrade them. 
Be careful to follow the upgrade path explained <<_upgrade_from_rudder_3_0_or_older, above>>.

==== Protocol for reporting

Rudder 3.1 uses syslog messages over UDP by default for reporting, but if you upgraded
your server from a previous version, you will keep the previous setting which uses
syslog messages over TCP.

You should consider switching to UDP (in *Administration* -> *Settings* -> *Protocol*),
as it will prevent breaking your server in
case of networking or load issues, or if you want to manage a lot of nodes.
The only drawback is that you can lose reports in these situations. It does not
affects the reliability of policy enforcement, but may only temporarily affects
reporting on the server.
Read <<_rsyslog, perfomance notes>> about rsyslog for detailed information.

==== Upgrade manually installed relays (installed before 3.0)

With Rudder 2.11, there were no relay package and the configuration had to be done by hand.

To migrate a manually installed relay to 3.1 using the package, run the following intructions:

* Delete the previous Apache configuration file:
 
** `/etc/httpd/conf.d/rudder-default.conf file` on RHEL-like
** `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/rudder-default` file on Debian-like
** `/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/rudder-default.conf` file on SuSE 

* Install the relay package named *rudder-server-relay*.

This is enough to replace the relay configuration, and no change is needed on the root server.

==== Known issues

* After upgrade, if the web interface has display problems, empty your navigator cache and/or logout/login.
