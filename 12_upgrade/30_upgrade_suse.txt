[WARNING]

====

SLES 11 pre SP4 uses PostgreSQL 8.x by default, which is not recommended for Rudder and will cause serious performance degradation, and requires much more disk space in the long run.

Rudder 4.0 is tested for PostgreSQL 9.2 and higher. It still works with version 8.4 or 9.1, but not warranties are made that this will hold in the future. It is really recommanded to migrate to PostgreSQL 9.2 at least. 

Please look at <<install-server-sles>> for details.

====

[WARNING]

====

Rudder 4.1 requires Java RE version 8 or more, which is not packaged be default on SLES 11
On this platform, prior to upgrade Rudder, you will need to install Java RE 8, either from Oracle site https://www.java.com
or through any other means of your choice

====

and after the upgrade of these packages, restart jetty to apply the changes on the Web application:

----

service rudder-jetty restart

----

For Rudder Agent, upgrade the +rudder-agent+ package:

----

zypper update rudder-agent

----

You can now <<_technique_upgrade,upgrade your local techniques>>.
