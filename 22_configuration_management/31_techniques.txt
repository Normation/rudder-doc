=== Techniques

==== Concepts

A Technique defines a set of operations and configurations to reach the
desired behaviour. This includes the initial set-up, but also a regular check on
the parameters, and automatic repairs (when possible).

All the Techniques are built with the possibility to change only part of a
service configuration: each parameter may be either active, either set on the
"Don't change" value, that will let the default values or in place. This allows
for a progressive deployment of the configuration management.

Finally, the Techniques will generate a set of reports which are sent to
the Rudder Root Server, which will let you analyse the percentage of compliance
of your policies, and soon, detailed reports on their application.

==== Manage the Techniques

The Techniques shipped with Rudder are presented in a library that you can
reorganize in *Configuration > Techniques*. The library
is organized in two parts: the available Techniques, and the selection
made by the user.

include::../glossary/active-techniques.txt[]

[TIP] 

====

The current version of Rudder has only an handful of *Techniques*.  We are
aware that it considerably limits the use of the application, but we choose to
hold back other Techniques that did not, from our point of view, have the
sufficient quality. In the future, there will be some upgrades including more
Techniques.

[WARNING] 

====

The creation of new Techniques is not covered by the Web interface. This
is an advanced task which is currently not covered by this guide.
