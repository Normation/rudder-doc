=== Compliance

A Directive contains one or multiple components. Each component generates
one ore multiple reports, based on the number of keys in this component. For
example, for a Sudoers Directive, each user is a key. These states are
available in reports:

Success::

The system is already in the desired state. No change is needed. Conformity is
gained.

Repaired::

The system was not in the desired state. Rudder applied some change and repaired
what was not correct. Now the system is in the desired state. Conformity is
gained.

Error::

The system is not in the desired state. Rudder couldn't repair the system.

Applying::

When a Directive is applied, Rudder waits during 10 minutes for a report.
During this period, the Directive is said 'Applying'.

No answer::

The system didn't sent any reports. Rudder waited for 10 minutes and no report
was received.

A Directive has gained conformity on a Node if every report for each
component, for each key, is in 'Success' state. This is the only condition.

Based on these facts, the compliance of a Rule is calculated like
this :

Number of Nodes for which conformity is reached for every Directive of the
Rule / Total number of Nodes on which the Rule has
been applied
