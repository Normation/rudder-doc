=== Validation workflow in Rudder

In Rudder 2.6.0, We added a feature to validate changes made by users before they are applied in the configuration.
This feature is optionnal and be disabled without any problem.
To enabled it you have to change the propriety 'rudder.workflow.enable' to true in */opt/rudder/etc/rudder-properties.xml*
Workflow main goals are to improve safety and knowledge sharing between your team.

When the validation workflow is enabled in Rudder, all changes made will needs to be validated.
Almost every changes about Rule, Directives or Groups will be embedded in a Change request.

==== What is a Change request ? 

A Change request represents a modification of a Rule/Directive/Group from an old state to a new one.
The Chnage is not saved and applied by the configuration, before that, it needs to be reviewed and approved by other members of the team.

A Change request has:

- An Id (an integet > 0)
- A title.
- A description.
- A creator.
- A status.
- Its own history.

Those informations can be updated on the change request detail page.
For now, a Change request is linked to one change at a time.

===== Change request status

There is 4 Change request status:

Pending validation::
- The change has to be reviewed and validated.
- Can be send to: Pending deployment, Deployed, Cancelled.

Pending deployment::
- The change was validated, but now require to be deployed.
- Can be send to: Deployed, Cancelled.

Deployed::
- The change is deployed.
- This is a final state, it can't be moved anymore.

Cancelled::
- The change was not approved.
- This is a final state, it can't be moved anymore.

Here is a diagram about all those states and transitions:

===== Change request management page 

All Change requests can be seen on the /secure/utilities/changeRequests page.
There is a table containing all requests, you can access to each of them by clicking on their id.
You can filter change requests by status and only display what you need.

==== How to create a Change request ? 

If they are enabled in Rudder, every change in Rudder will make you create a Change request.
You will have a popup to enter the name of your change request and a change message.

The change message will be used as description for you Change Request, so we advise to fill it anyway to keep an explanation ab out your change.

Change request are not available for Rule/Directive/Groups creation, they are only active if the Rule/Directive/Groups existed before:

Here is a small table about all possibilities:

==== How to validate a Change request ?

===== Roles 

Not every user can validate or deploy change in Rudder.
Only those with one of the following roles can act on Change request:

Validator::
Can validate Change request 

Deployer::
To deploy Change Request

Both of those roles:

- Give you access to pending Change requests
- Allow you to perform actions on them (validate or cancel)

You have to change users in */opt/rudder/etc/rudder-users.xml* and include those rights.
Without one of those roles, you can only access Change Request in 'Deployed' or 'Cancelled' and those you opened before.

You can deploy directly if you have both the validator and deployer roles.
The *administrator* Role gives you both the deployer and valdiator role.

There is also the possibility to access Change requests in Read only mode by using the role 'validator_read' or 'deployer_read'.

===== Self Validations

Using Change requests means that you want your team to share knowledge, and validate each other change.
So by default: 

- *Self validation* is disabled.
- *Self deployment* is enabled.

Those two behaviours can be changed in the property file */opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties*.
'rudder.workflow.self.validation' and 'rudder.workflow.self.deployment' are the properties that define this behaviour.

==== Change request and conflicts

When the initial state of a Change request has changed (ie: you want to modify a Directive, but someone else change about that Directive has been accepted before yours), your change can't be validated anymore.

image::./images/workflows/Conflict.png[]

For now, we decided to reduce to the possibility of an error or inconsitency when there is concurrent changes.
In a future version of Rudder, there will be a system to handle those conflicts, and make sure actual changes are not overwritten.

==== Notifications:

In several parts of Rudder webapp there is some Notifications about Change requests.

===== Pending change requests

This notification is displayed only if the validator/deployer role is active on your user account.
It show you how many Change requests are waiting to be reviewed/deployed.
clicking on it will lead you to the Change request management page, with a filter already applied.

===== Change already proposed on Rule/Directive/Group

When there is a change about the Rule/Directive/Group already proposed but not deployed/cancelled, you will be notified that there are some pending Change requests about that element.
You will be provided a Link to those change request, So you can check if the change is already proposed.
