=== Policy Instances

Once you have selected and organized your Policy Templates, you can create your
configurations in the *Configuration Management > Policy Instances* section.

include::../glossary/policy-instance.txt[]

The screen is divided in three parts:

- on the left, your list of Policy Templates and Policy Instances, 

- on the right the description of the selected Policy Template or Policy
  Instance.

- at the bottom, the configuration items of the selected Policy Instance. 

Click on the name of a Policy Template or to see its description. 

Click on the name of a Policy Instance to see the Policy Summary containing the
description of the Policy Template its derived from, and the configuration items
of the Policy Instance.

.Create a Policy Instance for Name resolution

====

Use the Policy Template 'Name resolution' to create a new Policy Instance called
+Google DNS Servers+, and shortly described as 'Use Google DNS Server'. Check in
the options 'Set nameservers' and 'Set DNS search suffix'.  Set the value of the
variable 'DNS resolver' to +8.8.8.8+ and of 'Domain search suffix' according to
your organization, like +rudder-project.org+.

====

[CAUTION]

.Manual escaping of value

====

The values you are inserting within the Policy Instance fields need to be manually
escaped most of the time, or else you will have deployment error.
Every quote ( " ) need to be prefixed by a backslash ( \" ), and backslash should
be prefixed by another backslash ( \\ ).
Indeed, CFEngine will consider a non-prefixed quote as the end of value, and it
considers \\ to mean \

However, there are no other escape character ( \n will not be considered as a new
line, etc).
