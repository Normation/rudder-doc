=== Node Inventory

Rudder integrates a node inventory tool which harvest useful information
about the nodes. This information is used by Rudder to handle the nodes, and
you can use the inventory information for Configuration Management purposes:
search Nodes, create Groups of Nodes, determine some configuration management
variables. 

In the Rudder Web Interface, each time you see a Node name, you can click on it
and display the collection of information about this Node. The inventory is
organized as following: first tab is a 'summary' of administrative information
about the Node; other tabs are specialized for 'hardware', 'network' interfaces,
and 'software' for every Node; tabs for 'reports' and 'logs' are added on
Rudder managed Nodes.

The 'Node Summary' presents administrative information like the Node
'Hostname', 'Operating System', 'Rudder Client name', 'Rudder ID' and 'Date'
when the inventory was 'last received'. When the Node has been validated, some
more information is displayed like the Node 'Name' and the 'Date first
accepted in Rudder'.

The 'hardware' information is organized as following: 'General', 'File
systems', 'Bios', 'Controllers', 'Memory', 'Port', 'Processor', 'Slot', 'Sound',
'Storage', 'Video'.

'Network' connexions are detailled as following: 'Name' of the interface on the
system, 'IP address', 'Network Mask', usage of 'DHCP' or static configuration,
'MAC address', 'Type' of connexion, 'Speed' of the connexion and 'Status'.

And finally, you get the list of every 'software' package present on the
system, including version and description.

On Nodes managed by Rudder, the 'Reports' tab displays information about the
status of latest run of Rudder Agent, whereas the 'Logs' tab displays
information about changes for the Node.
