=== Accept new Nodes

At the starting point, the Rudder Server does'nt know anything about the Nodes.
After the installation of the Rudder Agent, each Node registers itself to the
Rudder Server, and sends a first inventory. Every new Node must be manually
validated in the Rudder Web Interface to become part of Rudder Managed Nodes.
This task is performed in the *Node Management > Accept new Nodes* section of
the application. You can select Nodes waiting for an approval, and determine
whether you consider them as valid or not. Click on each Node name to display
the extended inventory. Click on the magnifying glass icon to display the
policies which will be applied after the validation.
