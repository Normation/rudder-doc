=== Search Nodes

You can navigate to *Node Management > Search Nodes* to display information
about the Nodes which have been already validated, and are managed by Rudder.

==== Quick Search

The easiest search tool is the Quick search: type in the search field the first
letters of the 'Rudder ID', 'Reference', or 'Hostname'; choose the accurate Node in
the autocompletion list; validate and look at the Node information. This search
tool can be very useful to help you create a new search in the Advanced Search.

.Quick search the Node called +debian-node+

====

Assuming you have one managed Node called +debian-node.rudder-project.org+,
which ID in Rudder is +d06b1c6c-f59b-4e5e-8049-d55f769ac33f+. 

. Type in the Quick Search field the +de+ or +d0+.

. Autocompletion will propose you this Node: +debian-node.rudder-project.org --
d06b1c6c-f59b-4e5e-8049-d55f769ac33f [d06b1c6c-f59b-4e5e-8049-d55f769ac33f]+.

==== Advanced Search 

In the Advanced Search tool, you can create complex searches based on Node
Inventory information. The benefit of the Advanced Search tool is to save the
query and create a Group of Nodes based on the search criteria.

- 1. Select a field

The selection of the field upon which the criteria will apply is a two step
process. The list of fields is not displayed unordered and extensively. Fields
have been grouped in the same way they are displayed when you look at
information about a Node. First you choose among these groups: 'Node', 'Network
Interface', 'Filesystem', 'Machine', 'RAM', 'Storage', 'BIOS', 'Controller',
'Port', 'Processor', 'Sound Card', 'Video Card', 'Software', 'Environment
 Variable', 'Processes', 'Virtual Machines'; then you choose
among the list of fields concerning this theme.

- 2. Select the matching rule

// FIXME: due to a bug in asciidoc, we cannot write '≠' 

The matching rule can be selected between following possibilities: 'Is defined',
'Is not defined', '=', ≠ or 'Regex'  followed by the term you are searching for presence or
absence. Depending on the field, the list of searchable terms is either an free
text field, either the list of available terms. 

- a. Regex matching rule

You can use regular expressions to find whatever you want in Node inventories.
A search request using a regexp will look for every node that match the pattern you
entered.

Those regexps follow Java Pattern rules. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
for more details.

.Search node having an ip address matching +192.168.x.y+

====

Assuming you want to search every node using an ip address match 192.168.x.y, where x<10 
and y could be everything. You will to add that line to your search request:

* 'Node summary', 'Ip address', +Regex+, '192\ .168\ .\d\ . .*'
 
====

- b. Composite search

Some fields allow you to look for more than one piece of information at a time.
That's the case for environment variable. for those fields you have to enter 
the first element then the separator then following elements.
The name of the fields tells you about what is expected. it would look like 
+firstelement<sep>secondelement+ assuming that <sep> is the separator.

.Search Environment Variable +LANG=C+.

====

Assuming you want to search every node having the environment variable LANG set to C.
You will have to add that search line to your request:

* 'Environment variable', 'key=value', +=+, 'LANG=C'.
 
====

- 3. Add another rule

You can select only one term for each matching rule. If you want to create more
complex search, then you can add another rule using the '+' icon. All rules are
using the same operand, either 'AND' or 'OR'. More complex searches mixing 'AND'
and 'OR' operands are not available at the moment.

.Advanced search for Linux Nodes with +ssh+.

====

Assuming you want to search all Linux Nodes having +ssh+ installed. You will
create this 2 lines request:

. Operator: +AND+.

. First search line: 'Node', 'Operating System', +=+, 'Linux'.

. Second search line: 'Software', 'Name', +=+, +ssh+.
