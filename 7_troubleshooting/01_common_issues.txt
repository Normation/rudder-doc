=== Some reports are in "No report"

==== If you get no reports at all for the Node

First thing to check is to see if reports were received by Rudder server.

Check the last report time (called *Last seen*) in *List Nodes* page.
If you see:

* *Never*: your Node is misconfigured or has a communication issue with the server
* A date far (more than 15 minutes) from current time:	Synchronize server and node time
* A recent date: check if the node has correctly updated

Now we will check if promises were updated on the Node. Maybe the node could not
update its promises anymore, even if the reporting looks ok and Rules seems to
be applied but report keeps in ‘No report’.

To check if a node can update its promises, run (on the node) 'rudder agent run'.
You’ll get the result of the ‘Update‘ component in the execution (in the 'Common' Technique).

To update its promises, a Node needs to get a directory on Rudder server
(/var/rudder/share/node_uuid), and Rudder checks if the node is authorized to
access that directory. This check is based on the capability to resolve the ip
as an accepted node. So if your node can’t update its promises, it’s
probably because of a DNS issue!

==== If you get incomplete reporting for the Node



When the agent does not perform a normal execution, the reports
will be incomplete, and some components will appear as missing on the server. Reasons could be:

* the execution of the agent encountered an error during its execution and could
not complete. In this case, an error message is displayed when running 'rudder agent run'. 
It is very likely a bug in the agent, please http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/projects/rudder/issues/new[report a bug]
* the agent is executed to launch specific bundles (with the '-b' option)
* reporting is missing on a Technique, in this case http://www.rudder-project.org/redmine/projects/rudder/issues/new[report a bug]

=== Communication issues between agent and server

==== DNS issues

If one of the following problems happen:

* the agent does not manage to get its configuration back from the server with weird errors
* the server complains about being unable to resolve the node hostname
* when starting or restarting Rudder (or rudder-agent) service, 'cf-serverd' start hangs

You probably have a name resolution problem. Please keep in mind that Rudder needs a working
name resolution environment to operate properly, and therefore every machine should be at
least able to resolve the name of their peer.

You have two options:

* Fix your DNS server or the '/etc/hosts' on both the server and the node, so
they can resolve each other (you can check using nslookup). You need to
restart rudder-agent on the server to apply it
* Disable hostname checking
on the server in *Administration* -> *Settings* -> *Use reverse DNS lookups on nodes
to reinforce authentication to policy server*. This is the preferred solution if you
have nodes behind a NAT.

==== Inventory issues

If you cannot send inventories to the server, it may be because of a proxy configured in
'/etc/profile' or shell configuration. Rudder agents use cURL to send inventories to
their server, and the server actually uses it too to send received inventories to the
inventory web application. There are two solutions usable to prevent this problem:

* Disable the proxy temporarily in your shell session, so Rudder can operate freely:

----
unset http_proxy; unset https_proxy; unset ftp_proxy; unset ftps_proxy; unset HTTP_PROXY; unset HTTPS_PROXY; unset FTP_PROXY; unset FTPS_PROXY
----

* If you are using the Squid proxy, you are in luck, as the workaround might simply
be to add this entry to your '/etc/squid/squid.conf': 'ignore_expect_100 on', it will
make Squid more tolerant to programs like cURL than send some terse http requests.
(Thanks to Albaro A. for this tip!)

=== Technique editing

If you have committed an invalid technique, then fixed it and commited it again,
but the webapp still doesn't  start, you have to force Technique library reloading.

To do this, deleting the attribute techniqueLibraryVersion from entry 
'techniqueCategoryId=Active Techniques,ou=Rudder,cn=rudder-configuration' in your
Rudder LDAP backend. When re-starting, the webapp should now reload latest techniques.

=== Database is using too much space

Rudder stores a lot of data in the Postgresql database, and most historical data 
is removed from it. You can <<_automatic_postgresql_table_maintenance,configure>> how many days of logs you want to keep in 
the database. However, due to the nature of Postgresql, when data are removed,
space is not reclaimed on the storage system, it is simply marked as “free” for 
the database to write again in the removed rows. This space can be reclaimed by 
a VACUUM FULL, but it needs at least as much free space on the drive as the database size.
If you are using Postgresql 8.4, which is not a recommended version, you’ll be likely to experience indexes bloating, where the physical size of the indexes grows without real reason, and need to be regularly purged.
With PostgreSQL 9.2 and later, database size should remain stable, based on the number of
nodes and configurations applied as described in <<_automatic_postgresql_table_maintenance,this estimation of disk usage>>

There are two ways to reclaim space, the fast one (which doesn’t reclaim completely
all wasted space), and the complete one (which is unfortunately very slow)

Fast solution (especially for 8.x version of postgresql):
Simply reindexing the database will save some space; depending on the size of your
database, it may take several minutes to a couple of hours

----
# First, stop the Rudder server
rudder agent disable
service rudder-jetty stop

# Then log into postgresql
psql -U rudder -h localhost
REINDEX TABLE ruddersysevents;

#Exit postgresql
\q

# Restart the Rudder server
rudder agent enable
service rudder-jetty start
----

Complete solution:
this solution will reclaim all that can be reclaimed, but is really really slow (can last several hours)

----
# First, stop the Rudder server
rudder agent disable
service rudder-jetty stop

# Then log into postgresql
psql -U rudder -h localhost
drop index component_idx;
drop index composite_node_execution_idx;
drop index keyvalue_idx;
drop index nodeid_idx;
drop index ruleid_idx;
drop index executiontimestamp_idx;
vacuum full ruddersysevents; — this will take several hours

create index nodeid_idx on RudderSysEvents (nodeId);
CREATE INDEX executionTimeStamp_idx on RudderSysEvents (executionTimeStamp);
CREATE INDEX composite_node_execution_idx on RudderSysEvents (nodeId, executionTimeStamp);
CREATE INDEX component_idx on RudderSysEvents (component);
CREATE INDEX keyValue_idx on RudderSysEvents (keyValue);
CREATE INDEX ruleId_idx on RudderSysEvents (ruleId);

# Exit postgresql
\q

# Restart the Rudder server
rudder agent enable
service rudder-jetty start
