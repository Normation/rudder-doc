= Enforce part of line in a file

Enforcing part of a line, to ensure that some parameter is set, or setting some left hand side, allows
to roll out changes in files you can't control completely.

Managing the values of key->value lines is the easiest use case, by using the generic methods https://docs.rudder.io/techniques/current/file_key_value_present.html[file_key_value_present],
https://docs.rudder.io/techniques/current/file_key_value_present_option.html[file_key_value_present_option] or even more complex use cases https://docs.rudder.io/techniques/current/file_key_value_parameter_present_in_list.html[file_key_value_parameter_present_in_list].

For more complex changes, using the more powerful *File content* technique is necessary.

For instance, to change statements in `rsyslog.conf` file to ensure that logs from `local3.none` go to `/var/log/messages`,
it is necessary to edit file with "Line replacement regular expressions", to match lines ending by `/var/log/messages` and replacing
them by the desired content.

[NOTE]

--

Please note that the regular expressions are PCRE expressions, and the replacement needs to be convergent: the regular expression must not match the replaced string.

--

So the regular expression must not match lines having `local3.none` as a source, and `/var/log/messages` as a destination, which translates as
`^(([A-Za-z0-9;.,*](?!local3\.none))*)\s+/var/log/messages` where:

* `^` is the start of the line (regex are not anchored)
* `[A-Za-z0-9;.,*]` are all the valid characters for source
* `(?!local3\.none)` to prevent matching line containing `local3.none`.

Captured sequence can be reused with the `$(match.X)` notation, where `X` represents the matched elements: `$(match.0)` is the whole string, `$(match.1)` is the first matched element, etc

The replacement should be:

----
$(match.1);local3.none        /var/log/messages
----

to add `;local3.none` at the end of the line.
