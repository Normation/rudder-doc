= Audit vs. Enforce - Policy Mode

[NOTE]

====

In this section you will:

* Analyze results from an audit policy
* Switch between audit and enforce modes to fix the configuration issues

====

As you saw just before, we configured one of our directives in "Audit mode".
You may have guessed what it means.

Rudder has two available xref:reference:usage:configuration_management.adoc#_policy_mode_audit_enforce[policy modes]:

* *Enforce*: it will modify the target system, if necessary, to achieve the expected state
* *Audit*: it will only report about non-compliant components

This is why you can see orange in compliance bars as they display techniques non-compliance in audit mode.

In our example, as the user _demo_ does not exist on a newly installed system, the node is not compliant to the desired state.

Let's change the policy mode of the directive by updating it. 
Navigate to the directive page by clicking on :

. *Directives* in the menu
. find *Demo user* in scrolling down the left part or in using the *Filter*
. select the directive
. change policy mode to *Global mode (enforce)* 
. *Save* the modification
. re-run the agent from the node terminal using ``$ rudder agent run``

Go back to the _demo_ user directive. You can use the Directive page, or use the quick search field, in the
header bar. Here you can search for any Rudder item (there is even a small query language!).

You will see the actual modification happening, with a "repaired" state, and the _demo_ user now exists
on the system. If you go back to the dashboard, everything is green and compliance has reached 100%.

_Audit/ Enforce modes_ can be used in many use cases. Basically, we recommand to use _Audit mode_ first and switch to _Enforce mode_ 
to remediate when you are sure the policy won't break anything important


We will now see how to manage other nodes, and more advanced configuration features.
