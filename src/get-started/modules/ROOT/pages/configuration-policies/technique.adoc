= Define a configuration policy

[NOTE]

====

In this section you will:

* Use Rudder's technique editor building blocks 
* Define a configuration policy within Rudder

====

TIP: A technique is a configuration policy template.

First, go to the xref:reference:usage:technique_editor.adoc#_techniques[Technique Editor] in *Configurations -> Techniques*. A configuration policy in Rudder is called a
xref:reference:usage:configuration_management.adoc#_techniques[technique].

You may have expected to start writing configuration code at this point. We won't!
(though it is also perfectly possible, but not the purpose of this guide).

Let's define a very simple policy: create a demo user. We will first create a new technique by clicking on *Create*.

We can now name our technique: _Demo user_, and add a small description for documentation:


How does this interface work?

* The left part is the list of techniques (empty for now, but our new technique will pop there once we save it)
* The center is the technique itself
* The right part is the "methods" column (and a category list to navigate within methods)

TIP: The xref:reference:reference:generic_methods.adoc[methods] are the building blocks used to form a technique. You can think of them as small bricks
you assemble into a technique. 

Let's start using methods to build a technique. Click on:

* the *Add* button to add methods
* the *User* category (in the lower right of the interface)
* the *User present* method

We have defined a first policy! 

Let's add a second method: 

* click on *Add methods* in the lower left of the technique details, to display the list of available methods,
* navigate to the *User* category. 
* add a user description, with the xref:reference:reference:generic_methods.adoc#_user_fullname[User fullname method]:

We now have specified one characteristic of our user.

Let's save this technique! (with the *Save* button). We now have a configuration policy
we can apply yo our machines.

== In Summary

image::technique_editor_save.png["Add more and save", align="center"]
image::technique_editor_first_technique_created.png["Overview of techniques", align="center"]

As you can see it is really simple to define the expected state for our machines
through this editor.
Later in this guide, we will get back to the xref:reference:usage:technique_editor.adoc#_techniques[Technique Editor] to explore the rest
of the features, but you already know enough to define a lot of configuration policies.
