= Define a configuration policy

[NOTE]

====

In this section you will:

* Use policy building blocks in the builder UI
* Define a configuration policy within Rudder

====

Here you will learn to define a configuration policy through Rudder's technique editor.
A technique is a configuration policy template, that will need to be instantiated afterwards.

Go to *Configuration policy -> Techniques*. A configuration policy in Rudder is called a technique.

You may have expected to start writing configuration code at this point. We won't!
(though it is also perfectly possible, but not the purpose of this guide).

Let's define a very simple policy: create a demo user. We will first create a new technique by clicking on *Create Technique*.

We can now name our technique: *Demo user*, and add a small description for documentation:

image::./new.png["New technique form", align="center"]

How does this interface work?

* The left part is the list of techniques (empty for now, but our new technique will pop there once we save it)
* The center is the technique itself
* The right part is the "methods" column (and a category list to navigate within methods)

The methods will be the building blocks to our technique. You can think of them as small bricks
you will assemble into a technique. Lets start the configuration, click on the *User* category (in the lower right of the interface),
and click on the *User present* method.
It is now part of our technique's component list, with an orange warning asking for parameters. To provide them, click on the method instance in the technique.

The right column will change from method list to method configuration:

We have defined a first policy! Let's add a second method: click on *Add methods*
in the lower left of the technique details, to display the list of available methods,
and navigate to the *User* category. Let's add a user description, with the *User fullname* method:

image::./fullname.png["demo user's fullname", align="center"]

We now have specified one characteristic of our user.

Let's save this technique! (with the *Save* button). We now have a configuration policy
we can apply yo our machines.

As you can see it is really simple to define the expected state for our machines
through this editor.
Later in this guide, we will get back to the technique editor to explore the rest
of the features, but you already know enough to define a lot of configuration policies.
