= Add a new machine

[NOTE]

====

In this section, you will see:

* How to manage a new machine with Rudder
* What does the Rudder server knows about managed nodes

====

In the demo platform, you have two nodes:

* The `server` we already used
* A `node` machine

If you used Vagrant to create the platform, it has provisoned the node by:

* installing rudder-agent
* configuring agent in defining Rudder server's ip with `$ rudder agent policy-server <rudder-server_ip>`
* sending to Rudder server node's inventory with `$ rudder agent inventory`

[TIP]

====

An *inventory* contains hardware and software information about a node.
It is sent to register the node to the server after agent installation, and then
gets updated daily (during the night, at a random time).

You can manually trigger an inventory with `$ rudder agent inventory`.

====



Let's accept our node:

. go to *Pending nodes*
. check the displayed node
. *Accept*

As a configuration has already been created and applied to all nodes managed by Rudder, it will be applied 
directly to the newly accepted node within 5 minutes. 
It includes the two directives we defined before.


Let's have a look at its inventory:

* go to *Nodes*. You can see two nodes displayed.
* click on your node hostname *node.rudder.local*
* switch to the *Inventory* tab


You can navigate through the tabs, to see OS, software and hardware information.
