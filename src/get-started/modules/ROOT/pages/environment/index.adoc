= Setup a test environment

[NOTE]

====

In this section you will:

* Setup your own Rudder test environment in virtual machines
* Have access to this platform for the rest of the tutorial

====

The rest of the tutorial assumes you are
using this environment (you can also setup your own,
you will only have to substitute hostnames/IP addresses when necessary).

This installation method is cross-platform, and you can use it on Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X
and more. You will need:

* https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox], to run the demo virtual machines
* https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[Vagrant], to handle the virtual machines configuration and provisioning

To instal them, run:

* `sudo apt install -y virtualbox vagrant` on Debian/Ubuntu systems
* `sudo yum install -y VirtualBox vagrant` on RHEL systems
* `sudo dnf install -y VirtualBox vagrant` on Fedora systems

Once they are installed, run:

----
git clone https://github.com/Normation/rudder-vagrant.git
cd rudder-vagrant
----

And then, to create the environment:

----
vagrant up
----

This will download the virtual machine image if needed, and will setup a Rudder environment using two virtual machines.

[TIP]

.Vagrant commands

====

Here are the basic vagrant commands useful to manage your environment:

* `vagrant up` to bring the environment up, wether the VM need to created or only started
* `vagrant halt` to stop the virtual machines (but keep them for later use)
* `vagrant destroy` to totally remove virtual machines
* `vagrant ssh server|agent` to connect to one of your nodes using SSH

====

Once the command returns, you are ready to get started! You now have access to two virtual machines,
`server` and `node`, with Rudder already installed.

You can connect to the server's Web interface on:

https://localhost:8081/rudder/

You have to accept the self-signed certificate generated during installation, and you will
see Rudder's login page.

You can login with:

* User: *admin*
* Password: *admin*

[NOTE]

====

You now have access to a full Rudder platform,
 to follow this guide or for later tests.
