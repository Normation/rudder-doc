= Apply a complete applicative policy

Now we have defined our technique, we will apply it.
To do so, got to the directives page (*Configuration management -> Directives*)
and find our new technique (for example by using the filter with "Website"),
and create a directive.

We will configure the site using the node property we defined in xref:node-management:data.adoc#_classify_nodes_using_node_properties[the node management section].

The syntax to use to access them is `${node.properties[property_name]}`.
Here we have hierarchical JSON, so we access a sub-key with `${node.properties[property_name][sub_key]}`.

This time our technique takes parameters, so we have to provide them:

* `${node.properties[website][webroot]}`
* `${node.properties[website][domain]}`
* `${node.properties[website][port]}`

Then you can see the rules zone at the bottom of the page.
It allows quickly linking a directive to a rule, as it is a common task in Rudder.

We will use it and select our *Demo Website* rule, then save the directive.
