= Apply a security policy



== Instanciate the policy in a directive

Now we created our technique, we will need to instanciate it and add it to our rule:

. go the *Directives* menu, scroll down, and create the directive *Disable weak ciphers*
. in the *Parameters* tab, add the parameter *aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr*.
This is a list of ciphers compliant to fips-140 2
. in the *Target rules* tab, click on our rule *Hardening baseline*

Now, our policy will be applied to our node. To check it, go to *Nodes*, select *node.rudder.local*, and switch to *Compliance* tab.
