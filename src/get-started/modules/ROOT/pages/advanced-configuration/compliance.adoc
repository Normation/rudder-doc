= Visualize compliance

== Trigger agent run

Now we have applied our directive, we can trigger its application by using two approaches:

* by using "Trigger Agent Run" straight from the webapp:

image::trigger-agent-run.png[Trigger directive application by trigger an agent run]


* by connecting to our node using ssh:

----
vagrant ssh node
----

And running the agent with:

----
rudder agent run -u
----

You should now be able to access your site:

----
$ curl http://localhost:8080
<html><h1>Welcome to Rudder demo!</h1></html>
----

== Rule compliance

In the first part we saw that Rudder provides a compliance view by node,
which allows identifying individual problems, but this compliance view is not suited
to get a general view of some policies compliance.

Rules, in addition to linking node and policies, provide a compliance entry point.

Go to your "Demo website" page (for example with the quick search field) and click on the rule.

It will display a compliance page with two parts:

* A global compliance view for the rule
* A by-node compliance view for the rule

They allow exploring compliance differently, based on what you are looking for.

At the bottom, you will see the *Recent changes* graph, which lists the changes
done by Rudder for this rule.
Click on a time slot and the details will be displayed in the table below.

Compliance is also available through Rudder API, allowing to monitor
and alert over compliance levels.
