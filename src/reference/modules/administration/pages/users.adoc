[[user-management]]
= User management

Change the users authorized to connect to the application.
You can define authorization level for each user

== Configuration of the users using a XML file

=== Generality

The credentials of a user are defined in the XML file
`/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-users.xml`. This file expects the following format:

----

<authentication hash="bcrypt" case-sensitivity="true">
  <user name="alice"  password="xxxxxxx" role="administrator"/>
  <user name="bob"    password="xxxxxxx" role="administration_only, node_read"/>
  <user name="custom" password="xxxxxxx" role="node_read,node_write,configuration_read,rule_read,rule_edit,directive_read,technique_read"/>
</authentication>

----

The name and password attributes are mandatory (non empty) for the user tags.
The role attribute can be omitted but the user will have no permission, and
only valid attributes are recognized.

Every modification of this file should be followed by a restart of the Rudder
web application to be taken into account:

----

systemctl restart rudder-jetty

----

[[_logins]]
=== Login

Your login is case-sensitive by default, to change this behavior yon can modify the parameter `case-sensitivity` to `false`
This option can be used to have consistent authentication constraints on login with an external xref:plugins:auth-backends.adoc[authentication provider] .

[CAUTION]
====

When you change the case-sensitivity, make sure there is no potential conflicts between logins, otherwise all conflicting
users will be ignored from Rudder.

====


[[_passwords]]
=== Passwords

The authentication tag should have a "hash" attribute, making "password" attributes
on every user expect hashed passwords. Not specifying a hash attribute will fallback
to plain text passwords, but it is strongly advised not to do so for security reasons.

The algorithm to be used to create the hash (and verify it during authentication)
depend on the value of the hash attribute. The possible values, the
corresponding algorithm and the Linux shell command need to obtain the hash of
the "secret" password for this algorithm are listed here:

.Hashed passwords algorithms list

[options="header"]

|====
|Value                 | Algorithm | Linux command to hash the password
|"bcrypt"              | BCRYPT    | htpasswd -nBC 12 ""  \| tr -d ':\n' \| sed 's/$2y/$2b/'
|"md5"                 | MD5       | read mypass; echo -n $mypass \| md5sum
|"sha" or "sha1"       | SHA1      | read mypass; echo -n $mypass \| shasum
|"sha256" or "sha-256" | SHA256    | read mypass; echo -n $mypass \| sha256sum
|"sha512" or "sha-512" | SHA512    | read mypass; echo -n $mypass \| sha512sum
|====

When using the suggested commands to hash a password, you must enter the
command, then type your password, and hit return. The hash will then be
displayed in your terminal. This avoids storing the password in your shell
history.

Here is an example of authentication file with hashed password:

----

<authentication hash="sha256" case-sensitivity="true">

  <!-- In this example, the hashed password is: "secret", hashed as a sha256 value -->
  <user name="carol" password="2bb80d537b1da3e38bd30361aa855686bde0eacd7162fef6a25fe97bf527a25b" role="administrator"/>

</authentication>

[[ldap-auth-provider, LDAP authentication provider for Rudder]]
== Configuring an LDAP authentication provider for Rudder

If you are operating on a corporate network or want to have your users in a
centralized database, you can enable LDAP authentication for Rudder users.

[CAUTION]
====

LDAP authentification requires the plugin `Authentication backends` to be installed.
Check the xref:plugins:auth-backends.adoc[plugin's documentation] to enable and configure your LDAP authentification.

====

=== LDAP is only for authentication

Take care of the following limitation of the current process: only *authentication*
is delegated to LDAP, NOT *authorizations*. So you still have to
declare user's authorizations in the Rudder user file (`rudder-users.xml`).

A user whose authentication is accepted by LDAP but not declared in the
`rudder-users.xml` file is considered to have no rights at all (and so will
only see a reduced version of Rudder homepage, with no action nor tabs available).


The credentials of a user are defined in the XML file
`/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-users.xml`. It expects the same format as regular file-based
user login, but in this case "name" will be the login used to connect to LDAP and the
'password' field will be ignored and should be set to "LDAP" to make it clear that
this Rudder installation uses LDAP to log users in.


Every modification of this file should be followed by a restart of the Rudder
web application to be taken into account:

----

systemctl restart rudder-jetty

----


== Authorization management

For every user you can define an access level, allowing it to access different
pages or to perform different actions depending on its level.

You can also build custom roles with whatever permission you want, using a type
and a level as specified in the xref:plugins:user-management.adoc[user-management plugin's documentation].

image::workflow_roles.png[Roles can match different types of users]


[CAUTION]
====

Defining and using different roles in Rudder require the `User-management` plugin.

====


== Going further

Rudder aims at integrating with your IT system transparently, so it can't force
its own authentication system.

To meet this need, Rudder relies on the modular authentication system Spring
Security that allows to easily integrate with databases or an
enterprise SSO like CAS, OpenID or SPNEGO. The documentation for this
integration is not yet available, but don't hesitate to reach us on this topic.
