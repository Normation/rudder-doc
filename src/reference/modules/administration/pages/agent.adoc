= Agent administration

== Package manager data caching

Linux agent caches information from the package manager to prevent overloading the system. It stores the list of installed packages on the system for 60 minutes, and the list of available updates for 240 minutes.

These values are configurable within the `rudder` node property, by overriding the `package.installed_cache_expire` and `package.updates_cache_expire` keys with group properties and/or node properties.
