== Use Rudder inventory in other tools

Rudder centralizes the information about your managed systems, and
you can use this information in other tools, mainly through the API.
We well here give a few examples.

=== Export to a spreadsheet

You can export the list of your nodes to a spreadsheet file (xls format) by using a
https://github.com/normation/rudder-tools/tree/master/contrib/rudder_nodes_list[tool] available in the rudder-tools repository.

Simple follow the installation instructions, and run it against your Rudder server.
You will get a file containing:

image::spreadsheet-list-nodes.png[]

You can easily modify the script to add other information.

== Existing third party integration

=== Rundeck

http://rundeck.org[Rundeck] is a tool that helps automating infrastructures, by
defining jobs that can be run manually or automatically. There is a
https://github.com/normation/rundeck-plugin-rudder[plugin] for Rundeck
that allows using Rudder inventory data in Rundeck.

With that plugin, you can execute commands on node registered in Rudder, taking
advantage of the groups defined for you policies.

=== Ansible

There is an https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/contrib/inventory/rudder.py[inventory plugin]
for Ansible that makes possible to use Rudder inventory (including groups, nodes,
group ids, node ids, and node properties) as inventory for Ansible, for example
for orchestration tasks on your platform. An inventory in Ansible is the list of managed nodes,
their groups and some pre-defined variables.

You need to download the https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/contrib/inventory/rudder.py[rudder.py]
and https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/contrib/inventory/rudder.ini[rudder.ini] files, then you have to
edit `rudder.ini` to fill (at least):

* Your Rudder server URL
* A valid API read-only token. It only needs to be able to read groups and nodes inventory data.

To specify the path of the configuration to the plugin, you can either:

* Put the `rudder.ini` next to the `rudder.py` file
* Define the `RUDDER_INI_PATH` environment variable with `export RUDDER_INI_PATH=/path/to/my_rudder.ini` before executing the ansible commands

Then you can start using it with the `-i rudder.py` option (to the Ansible command-line).
The plugin defines:

* An Ansible group for each Rudder group, with a group variable named `rudder_group_id` that contains the uuid of the group
* An host variable named `rudder_node_id` that contains the uuid of the node
* Host variables containing the Rudder node properties

You can then use them in the configuration, for example:

----
# To execute the hostname command evewhere and get the result
ansible -i rudder.py All_nodes -a "hostname"
# To use Rudder node id, group id and node properties inside ansible commands or playbooks
ansible -i rudder.py All_nodes -a "echo {{rudder_node_id}} {{rudder_group_id}} {{node_property}} {{node_property2.key}}"
----

Will try to connect over SSH to all nodes managed by your Rudder server and display the given information.

You can defined the `ansible_host`, `ansible_user` and `ansible_port` node properties to control
the way Ansible connects to the nodes.

=== iTop

https://www.combodo.com/itop-193[iTop] is an Open Source CMDB solution. It allows
to describe you IT services and analyse impact of problems.

There is a prototype integration of iTop and Rudder which allows iTop to Rudder
as a source of information about the server content (inventory) and current
compliance level. With that integration, you can see in real time in your CMDB when
a server managed by Rudder is drifting away from its expecting configuration, and
use iTop to understand the impact of such a drift for your IT services.


[[rudder-api-integration]]
== Integrate Rudder thanks to its APIs

All the above plugins are using https://docs.rudder.io/api[Rudder APIs]
under the hood to operate or get data from Rudders. Rudder APIs are as powerful
as the UI, and anything that can be done through the main graphical interface
can also be scripted away with the APIs.

The documentation provided on APIs is exhaustive, but here comes a summary of
what can be done with them:

- accept, delete a node and manage its parameters,
- get information with a parametrizable depth about node inventories,
- search for nodes,
- manage (create, update, delete) groups, directives, rules and parameters,
- interact with the Techniques library,
- get compliance details about a node or a rule, with a parameterized depth of
  information,
- manage change requests.

And of course, any plugin can provide new API endpoints, as is doing the
data source plugin.

These API can also be used to automate Rudder action, like node acceptation or compliance
export and archiving for nodes.
