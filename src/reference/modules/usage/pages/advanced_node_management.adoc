== Reinitialize policies for a Node

To reinitialize the policies for a Node, delete the local copy of the Applied
Policies fetched from the Rudder Server, and create a new local copy of the
initial policies.

----

rudder agent reset

----

At next run of the Rudder Agent (it runs every five minutes), the initial policies will be used.

[CAUTION]

====

Use this procedure with caution: the Applied Policies of a Node should never get
broken, unless some major change has occurred on the Rudder infrastructure, like
a full reinstallation of the Rudder Server.

====

== Completely reinitialize a Node

You may want to completely reinitialize a Node to make it seen as a new node
on the server, for example after cloning a VM.

[WARNING]

====

This command will permanently delete your node uuid and keys, and no configuration will
be applied before re-accepting and configuring the node on the server.

====

The command to reinitialize a Node is:

----

rudder agent reinit

----

This command will delete all local agent data, including its uuid and keys, and
also reset the agent internal state. The only configuration kept is the server
hostname or ip configured in +policy_server.dat+. It will also send an inventory
to the server, which will treat it as a new node inventory.

[[_change_the_agent_run_schedule]]
== Change the agent run schedule

By default, the agent runs on all nodes every 5 minutes. You can modify this value in
 *Settings* -> *General* page in *Agent Run Schedule* section, as well as the "splay time"
across nodes (a random delay that alters scheduled run time, intended to spread
load across nodes).

image::Global_run_settings.png[]

This settings can also be modified Node by Node, allowing you to customize the agent behavior (Node with little ressource like a Raspberry Pi or with limited bandwith). To do that, go into the Node details in the *Settings* tab

[WARNING]

====

When reducing notably the run interval length, reporting can be in 'No report' state
until the next run of the agent, which can take up to the previous (longer) interval.

== Installation of the Rudder Agent

=== Static files

At installation of the Rudder Agent, files and directories are created in
following places:

+/etc+:: Scripts to integrate Rudder Agent in the system (init, cron).

+/opt/rudder/share/initial-promises+:: Initialization policies for the Rudder
Agent. These policies are used until the Node has been validated in Rudder. They
are kept available at this place afterwards.

+/opt/rudder/lib/perl5+:: The FusionInventory Inventory tool and its Perl
dependencies.

+/opt/rudder/bin/run-inventory+:: Wrapper script to launch the inventory.

+/opt/rudder/bin+:: Binaries for agent.

+/var/rudder/cfengine-community+:: This is the working directory for the agent.

=== Generated files

At the end of installation, the agent's working directory is
populated for first use, and unique identifiers for the Node are generated.

+/var/rudder/cfengine-community/bin/+:: agent binaries are copied
there.

+/var/rudder/cfengine-community/inputs+:: Contains the actual working policies. Initial policies are copied here at installation. After
validation of the Node, Applied Policies, which are the policies
generated by Rudder for this particular Node, will be stored here.

+/var/rudder/cfengine-community/ppkeys+:: An unique SSL key generated for the
Node at installation time.

+/opt/rudder/etc/uuid.hive+:: An unique identifier for the Node is generated
into this file.

=== Services

After all of these files are in place, the agent daemons are
launched:

include::{partialsdir}/glossary/cf-execd.adoc[]

include::{partialsdir}/glossary/cf-serverd.adoc[]

=== Configuration

At this point, you should configure the Rudder Agent to actually enable the
contact with the server. Type in the IP address of the Rudder Root Server in the
following file:

----

echo *root_server_IP_address* > /var/rudder/cfengine-community/policy_server.dat

----

== Rudder Agent interactive

You can force the Rudder Agent to run from the console and observe what happens.

----

rudder agent run

----

[CAUTION]

.Error: the name of the Rudder Root Server can't be resolved

====

If the Rudder Root Server name is not resolvable, the Rudder Agent will issue
this error:

----

rudder agent run

Unable to lookup hostname (rudder-root) or cfengine service: Name or service not known

----

To fix it, either you set up the agent to use the IP address of the Rudder root
server instead of its Domain name, either you set up accurately the name
resolution of your Rudder Root Server, in your DNS server or in the hosts file.

The Rudder Root Server name is defined in this file

----

echo *IP_of_root_server* > /var/rudder/cfengine-community/policy_server.dat

----

====

[CAUTION]

.Error: the rudder-agent service is not responding on the Rudder Root Server

====

If the rudder-agent is stopped on the Rudder Root Server you will get this error:

----

# rudder agent run
 !! Error connecting to server (timeout)
 !!! System error for connect: "Operation now in progress"
 !! No server is responding on this port
Unable to establish connection with rudder-root

----

Restart the rudder-agent service:

----

service rudder-agent restart

----

====

== Processing new inventories on the server

=== Verify the inventory has been received by the Rudder Root Server

There is some delay between the time when the first inventory of the Node is
sent, and the time when the Node appears in the New Nodes of the web interface.
For the brave and impatient, you can check if the inventory was sent by listing
incoming Nodes on the server:

----

ls /var/rudder/inventories/incoming/

----

=== Process incoming inventories

On the next run of the agent on Rudder Root Server, the new inventory
will be detected and sent to the Inventory Endpoint. The inventory will be then
moved in the directory of received inventories. The Inventory Endpoint do
its job and the new Node appears in the interface.

You can force the execution of agent on the console:

----

rudder agent run

----

=== Validate new Nodes

User interaction is required to validate new Nodes.

=== Prepare policies for the Node

Policies are not shared between the Nodes for obvious security and
confidentiality reasons. Each Node has its own set of policies. Policies are
generated for Nodes according in the following states:

. Node is new;

. Inventory has changed;

. Technique has changed;

. Directive has changed;

. Group of Node has changed;

. Rule has changed;

. Regeneration was forced by the user.

== Agent execution frequency on nodes

=== Checking configuration

By default, Rudder is configured to check and repair configurations using the
agent every 5 minutes, at 5 minutes past the hour, 10 minutes past the hour,
etc.

The exact run time on each machine will be delayed by a random interval, in
order to "smooth" the load across your infrastructure (also known as "splay
time"). This reduces simultaneous connections on relay and root servers (both
for the policy server and for sending reports).

See xref:usage:advanced_node_management.adoc#_change_the_agent_run_schedule[Change the agent run schedule] Section to see how to configure it

=== Inventory

The FusionInventory agent collects data about the node it's running on such as
machine type, OS details, hardware, software, networks, running virtual
machines, running processes, environment variables...

This inventory is scheduled once every 24 hours, and will happen in between
0:00 and 5:00 AM. The exact time is randomized across nodes to "smooth" the
load across your infrastructure.


[[extend-nodes-inventory, Extend node inventory]]

== Extend node inventory


It is quite common to need to gather information on your nodes that are not present
in the standard Rudder inventory information.

As of Rudder 4.3.0, you can get more information about a node thanks to
`inventory hooks`. These information will be available as standard *node properties*.


=== Overview

On the node, you create `inventory hooks` executable and place them in `/var/rudder/hooks.d`.
These binaries are executed in the alphanumerical order, only if executable, and their output is checked to
ensure that it is proper JSON.

For example, one hook can output:

----

{
    "my_prop1": ["a", "json", "array"],
    "my_prop2": {"some": "more", "key": "value"}
}

----

When the node inventory is processed server side, the node properties will get new values, one per
first-level key of all hooks.

These node properties are marked as "provided by inventory" and can not be deleted nor overwritten.
Appart from that characteristic, they are normal node properties that can be used to create group, or as
variables in Directives parameters.

=== Creating a node inventory hook

An inventory hook can be any kind of executable that can be called without parameters, from a shell script to a C program.

Hooks are located in directory `/var/rudder/hooks.d`. You may need to create that directory the first time you want to add hooks:

----

mkdir /var/rudder/hooks.d

----

They need to be executable by rudder agent.

For example, this hook will create a new "hello_inventory" node property:

----

% cd /var/rudder/hooks.d

% cat <<EOF > hello-world
#!/bin/sh
echo '{"hello_inventory": "a simple string value from inventory"}'
EOF

% chmod +x hello-world

% rudder agent inventory

----

And then, after the server has processed the inventory, the node (here with ID '74d10806-b41d-4575-ab86-8becb419949b') has the corresponding property:

----
% curl -k -H "X-API-Token: ......" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET 'https://..../rudder/api/latest/nodes/74d10806-b41d-4575-ab86-8becb419949b?include=minimal,properties' | jq '.'
{
  "action": "nodeDetails",
  "id": "74d10806-b41d-4575-ab86-8becb419949b",
  "result": "success",
  "data": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "74d10806-b41d-4575-ab86-8becb419949b",
        ....
        "properties": [
          {
            "name": "hello_inventory",
            "value": "a simple string value from inventory",
            "provider": "inventory"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
----


=== Overriding

If two hooks provide the same first-level key, then the last executed hook values for that key are kept.

You should always use the first level keys as a namespace for your hooks to avoid unwanted overriding.


=== Inventory XML format

Properties comming from inventory hooks are stored in a tag named `<CUSTOM_PROPERTIES>`. The tag contains a
JSON array with all the inventory hook properties merged:

----

<CUSTOM_PROPERTIES>[{ "key1" : "values"},{ "key2" : "values"}]</CUSTOM_PROPERTIES>

----


[[node-lifecycle, Node Lifecycle]]

== Node Lifecycle

Imagine you have a node that you must disconnect for a maintenance period.
You know what is happening on the node, and during the maintenance period,
you don't want that the Rudder shows up the node as `Not responding`
and trigger alert on global compliance level.

An other common use case is to be able to set specific policies for nodes
just after acceptation that are used for provisioning, or just before
node end of life to clean it up.

In Rudder 4.3, we introduced a way to manage the Node lifecycle, for both of theses uses cases:

* nodes disconnected from Rudder Server can be excluded from policy generation and Compliance with the `Ignored` state,
* the main states of a system life can be applied with the 4 states `Initializing`, `Enabled`,
`Preparing End of Life` and `Empty policies`.


image::node-lifecycle-settings.png[]


States `Ignored` and `Empty policies` automatically changes the policy generation and compliance:

* `Ignored` prevents any new policy generation for the Nodes in this states.
* `Empty policies` generates a minimal set of policies, only to manage the Rudder Agent itself.

Both states remove the nodes from the compliance.

Nodes with non-default state appears with a label next to their name in the nodes list to show their
states, and their compliance doesn't show up in `Ignored` nor `Empty policies` mode. You can filter by
node lifecycle state in that list with the common `Filter` input field.

image::node-lifecycle-nodelist.png[]


Node with a given lifecycle state can be searched thanks to the quick search tool in Rudder status
bar. That state can also be used to construct groups (`Node state` attribute of `Node summary`)
and they also show up in the API responses concerning node information.

Finally, the default state for a Node can be configured in the Settings page, to define in which
mode accepted Nodes use.

image::node-lifecycle-settings.png[]


In the future, these states will be configurable on a per node basis at acceptation, and the
lifecycle states list will be configurable by users.
