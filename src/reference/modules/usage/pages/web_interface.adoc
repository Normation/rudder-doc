= Web interface usage

This chapter is a general presentation of the Rudder Web Interface. You will
find how to authenticate in the application, a description of the design of the
screen, and some explanations about usage of common user interface items like
the search fields and the reporting screens.

== Authentication

When accessing the Rudder web interface for the first time, it will
ask you to create an admin account.

You can create and modify user accounts by following the xref:administration:users.adoc#user-management[user management]
procedure.

== Presentation of Rudder Web Interface

The web interface is organised according to the concepts described earlier. It
is divided in three logical parts: Node Management, Configuration Management
and Administration.

=== Rudder Home

The home page summarizes the content of the other parts and provides quick links
for the most common actions.

=== Node Management

In the Node Management section, you will find the list of all Nodes, the validation tool for new
Nodes, a search engine for validated Nodes, and the management tool for groups
of Nodes.

.Node compliance

.Groups

=== Configuration Management

In the Configuration Management section, you can select the Techniques,
configure the Directives and manage the Rules and check their compliance.

=== Utilities

This section contains tools useful for your everyday usage of Rudder.
This is where you will find the technique editor, the event logs table
or the change requests if you have enabled that feature.

.Technique Editor

.Technique details

=== Settings

The Settings section provides you a way to modify your Rudder setup: you can setup the
available networks for the Policy Server, configure agent run and policy mode,
enable web interface options and manage installed plugins.

[[quick-search-anything, Quick Search Anything]]

== Quick search anything

You might have noticed the small text area at the top of the Rudder interface:
it is the Quick Search bar. Its purpose is to enable a user to easily search for
Rudder elements (Nodes, Groups, Directives, Parameters, Rules)  based on their
name, id, description, inventory...

image::rudder-quicksearch.png[Quicksearch]

An autocompletion list will appear as soon as Rudder detects an element it can
identify, you just have to click on it to be redirected to the element's
configuration page.

More complex search queries can be input using the *in:* and *is:* keywords,
*is* targets Rudder objects by type, and *in* targets elements like name,
description...

Those keywords are used to refine a research in case a search query returns
too many results.

For example, the naive request for *root* policy server will likely returns far too
many results, because *root* appears in most node *policy server ID* field:

.Example: A lookup for *root* will return far too many results

====

root

====

So you will need to be more precise and stipulate that you only want to search for
nodes whose *nodeid* is *root*:

.Example: Only search for the node whose ID is *root*

====

root is:node in:id

====

.Example: Search for a Node called *debian-node*

====

Assuming you have one managed Node called +debian-node.example.com+,
whose ID in Rudder is +d06b1c6c-f59b-4e5e-8049-d55f769ac33f+.

. Type in the Quick Search field the *de* or *d0*.

. The search result will return this Node: *debian-node.example.com --
d06b1c6c-f59b-4e5e-8049-d55f769ac33f [d06b1c6c-f59b-4e5e-8049-d55f769ac33f]*.

====

.Example: Search for a directive called +Common users+

====

Assuming you have one Directive called *Common users*,
whose ID in Rudder is *6e8ce05b-3f77-4fed-a424-edf0fdaa4231*.

. Type in the Quick Search field *is:directive common*.

. The search result will return this Directive: *Common users --
4a6aaea7-6471-4ca9-8c27-9ee9f44ed882 [6e8ce05b-3f77-4fed-a424-edf0fdaa4231]*.
