= Advanced configuration management

== Policy generation

Each time a change occurs in the Rudder interface, having an impact on the
policy needed by a node, it is necessary to regenerate the modified
policies for every impacted node. By default, this process is launched after each
change.

The process of policy generation:

* Use configured policies and information about the nodes to generate
  the files defining the policy that reflects the desired state
* Compute and store expected reports that will be produced when executing these policies
* Check the validity of the generated policies
* Replace the old version of the policies by the new one for impacted node
* Restart the policy server on the Rudder central server is authorizations have changed

You can customize some of these actions and add new ones using the xref:usage:advanced_configuration_management.adoc#_server_event_hooks[Server Event Hooks].

image::policy_generation.png[Status of policy generation]

=== +Update policies+ button

The button +Update policies+ on the top right of the screen, in the +Status+ menu, allows you to force
the regeneration of the policies. As changes in the inventory of the nodes are
not automatically taken into account by Rudder, this feature can be useful
after some changes impacting the inventory information.

=== +Regenerate all policies+ button

The button *Regenerate all policies* on the top right of the screen, in the *Status* menu, allows you to force
the regeneration of all policies. It will clear all internal caches, and force a complete
computation of the policies. This is generally useful to make sure everything is correct after a problem
on the central server.

=== Policy generation info log

Policy generation is a complex process, and it is central to Rudder use. You will often want to know more
about a policy generation result: what was the reason for a failure? What nodes where updated? Or even
more specific info like: where are info and debug log?

==== /var/rudder/policy-generation-info

Directory `/var/rudder/policy-generation-info` contains information about the last policy generation(s)
in the following files:

- `last-failure-message`: when a generation fails, failure message is stored here. It is helpful for
  debugging purpose (for example when message is very long), or to know what happened in case of
  transient errors.
- `last-updated-nodeids`: this file contains list of node updated in last generation. It is in a
  source-able format which defined three bash array:
  - `RUDDER_UPDATED_POLICY_SERVER_IDS`: contains the set of updated policy servers (root or relay)
  - `RUDDER_UPDATED_NODE_IDS`: contains the set of updated standard nodes
  - `RUDDER_NODE_IDS`: contains both updated policy server and nodes. Policy servers always come first.

Each file starts with a comment describing what policy generation generated it.
Two version of each of these files is conserved: the oldest one has a `.old` suffix.

==== `webapp` logs

Rudder web application logs located in `/var/log/rudder/webapp/yyyy_MM_dd.stderrout.log` contains information
about policy generation process. All policy generation logs are gathered under `policy.generation`
namespace (with optionally more precise namespace, like `policy.generation.timing` for timing information, or
`policy.generation.update` for updated nodes, etc).
By default, policy generation logs when it starts with generic information about system:

----

----

Much more information can be logged about policy generation (hook execution and timing, much more precise timing,
updated nodes, files written, etc). All corresponding logs and verbosity levels are documented and controlled
in `/opt/rudder/etc/logback.xml`.

[[_server_event_hooks]]
== Server Event Hooks

Files (hooks), typically scripts, can be executed on the server, when some predefined event occurs on Rudder.

include::{partialsdir}/dyn/hooks.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


== New directives default naming scheme

When a new directive is created, by default the 'Name' field is filled
with the Technique name. For example, if you create a new Directive from
the 'Users' Technique, the Name field will get the value: "Users".

This not always what you want, especially for your custom Techniques. So you
have the possibility to define new default values for Name, at Technique or
at Technique and Version granularity.

This is done by adding or updating the file:
`/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques/default-directive-names.conf`.

That file need to be committed in git, and the Technique library reloaded
to take effect:

----
cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques/
vi default-directive-names.conf
 ....
git add default-directive-names.conf
git commit -m "Change default names for new directives"
rudder server reload-techniques
----

The file format is a simple `techniqueId[/optionalVersion]: default name to use` format.
The Technique ID is the name of the directory containing the Technique version directory
in `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques`.

For example, if we imagine that in your company, you have the internal
convention to create one directive by user role with the login in the
name, you would prefer to have a default value to:

----
Role <user-role>: <matching-login>
----

And then, for Users Technique version 7, you changed your mind and now
use the scheme:

----
Role: [user-role] (with login [login])
----

Then the file will look like:

----
# Default pattern for new directive from "userManagement" technique:
userManagement= Role <user-role>: <matching-login>

# For userManagement version 2.0, prefer that pattern in new Directives:
userManagement/7.0: Role: [user-role] (with login [login])
----


== Policies ordering

Configuration in Rudder is based on desired states, describing the expected state of the system, and not an ordered list of actions to run.
However, there are cases where having order is desirable (like ensuring that a JVM is present before deploying an Application server, or ensuring a user is present before setting it sudoers), even if it will converge over the course of several agent runs.

Rudder sorts the policies following this (best-effort) principle:

* Methods in a technique are executed in the order they appear in the interface
* Rules are executed in alphanumeric order
* Inside a rule, directives are executed in alphanumeric order, except for:

** *Mono-instance* techniques: only one directive is selected and others are discarded (and they will be tagged as such in node detail compliance)

*** the directive with the highest priority will be selected
*** in case of equal priorities, the rule name and then the directive name are used for sorting them (in alphanumeric order)

** *Limited multi-instance* techniques: all directives will be merged into *one* policy on the node

*** the merge order is based on priority, then rule name, and then directive name
*** the place of the merged policy itself in the global policies will be based on the rule and directive names of its most priority source directive

NOTE: The type of a technique is visible when clicking on the technique itself in the directives page.

.Best practice
[TIP]
=====
You should always start Rules and Directives name by 2 (or 3) digits to be able to easily reorder Policy evaluation if the need happen:

Do not use: "My general security rule" and "Check ssh configuration"

But use: "05. My general security rule" and "40. Check ssh configuration"
=====

=== Advanced example

- given three Techniques A, B and C
- directives A1 and A2 based on Technique A, directives B1 and B2 based on B, directives C1 and C2 based on C
- all Directives have the same priority,
- rule R0 having [C1], R1 having [A1, B2] and rule R2 having [A2, B1, C2], all applied on a same node,
- merging (R0, C1) and (R2, C2) => [C1, C2] and keep (R0, C1) as Policy order
- merging (R1, A1) and (R2, A2) => [A1, A2] and keep (R1, A1) as Policy order,
- merging (R1, B2) and (R2, B1) => [B2, B1] (because R1 < R2) and keep (R1, B2) for policy order,
- so policies are sort: (R0, C1) then (R1, A1) then (R1, B2)
- resulting ordering of directive's values will be: [C1, C2] then [A1, A2] then [B1, B2]

== Share files between nodes

There is a way to share files from one node to another.
It allows a node to send a file to its relay, which will make it available
for another target node, that has to specifically download it.

This file sharing method is secured by:

* The control of uploaded file signature by the server, to check it matches the source node's private key.
* The same mechanism as standard file copy in Rudder to download the shared file from the server.

It also includes a ttl mechanism that allows sharing a file for a limited amount of time.

To use this feature, two generic methods are available in the technique editor:

* xref:reference:generic_methods.adoc#sharedfile_from_node[sharedfile_from_node]: To download a file shared from another node.
* xref:reference:generic_methods.adoc#sharedfile_to_node[sharedfile_to_node]: To make a file available to another node.

See the documentation of these methods for details about the required parameters,
and especially xref:reference:generic_methods.adoc#sharedfile_to_node[sharedfile_to_node] for a complete usage example.

== Update technique resources from command line

Techniques can have resource files that are automatically deployed to each node applying these techniques.

Technique resources can be modified via the technique editor interface.

It can however be useful to update a technique resource from outside the interface, for example to update it after an external change.
To do this, on your Rudder server, edit the technique resource file(s) located in
`/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques/<technique category>/<technique name>/<technique version>/resource`

Then add them to git and reload the technique:

----
cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques/<technique category>/<technique name>/<technique version>/
git add resource
git commit -m"My technique resource updated"
rudder server reload-techniques
----

You're done.


== Import / Export archive of rules, directives, techniques, groups and related dependencies

This feature introduces the possibility to export configuration items (rules, directives, techniques, groups) and
their dependencies (for example, the technique used to define a directive, or the directives and groups for rules) into `ZIP` archive
and import them back.

This feature may be used to transfer configuration items from a development environment to a qualification one, or to edit by hand
in a third party system some aspects of the configuration items and then import them back into Rudder. It is only available through API queries.

This section will present you the main aspect of the feature usage: exports items, control dependency resolution, and
import the archive back.
For all API related operation, you can check https://docs.rudder.io/api/v/18/#tag/Archives[the corresponding API documentation].

=== Export configuration items

The first aspect of the archive feature allows exporting configuration items and their dependencies into a `ZIP` archive.
The most common use case is to export a rule and its directives (with related user defined techniques) and groups so that it can be transferred into another
rudder server.
Another common use case is to export a set of configuration items, for example to build a template of a configuration that needs to span on several rules.
Let's see these two use cases in turn.
The last use case described here will be how to retrieve configuration items at a specific past revision.

==== Exporting a rule with its directives, techniques and groups

Once you have found the rule's ID (for example, in the rule details page), you just need to call the export API with that parameter: all dependencies up to techniques are
resolved and included by default. This is equivalent to using the parameter `include=all` as shown in the command below.

[NOTICE]
----
System configuration items are not included in the archive, so for example you will not get system groups used by a rule in the archive (of course, the rule configuration
still use them if the archive if imported back).
----

----
curl -k -X GET -H "X-API-TOKEN: ...." 'https://rudderhost/rudder/api/latest/archives/export?rules=2278f76f-28d3-4326-8199-99561dd8c785&include=all' -o archive.zip
----

==== Archive internal

Now, we will take a quick look at the content of an archive.

[CAUTION]
----
Remember, even if the general layout is likely to be stable, file format WILL change.
----

----
% unzip archive.zip
Archive:  archive.zip
   creating: archive/
....

% ls
archive  archive.zip

% tree archive

                    └── motd.ps1.st
----

We see that the archive has a standard directory layout looking like the one in `/var/rudder/configuration-repository`.
In each directory, you find serialisation of the corresponding configuration items.
For rules, directives, and groups, the file has the item name normalized. The content is the same as the one you get when you query the item details on REST API.
For techniques, the subdirectory layout and technique content is exactly the same as the one in have in `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques`.

You can update content in that archive, create a new `ZIP` with the following command, and import it back into rudder to update policies.
For example:

- edit the rule `shortDescription` property in `archive/rules/Generic_rule_for_all_env.json`
- zip back:

----
% zip -r archive.zip archive
  adding: archive/ (stored 0%)
  adding: archive/techniques/ (stored 0%)
  adding: archive/techniques/systemSettings/ (stored 0%)
...
----

And see next chapter for importing it.

==== Exporting a set of rules and directives for configuration templating

Another common use case is when you need several rules with specific directive to achieve a configuration need on several OS - typically, you want to enforce
some security checks on Debian and Redhat, but these checks vary.
So you develop things in QA, and when it's ok, you import them prod - but not the groups, which are different.
For that, you will restrict the scope of what dependencies are included in the archive (`rule1` and `rule2` are used in place of UUIDs for readability):

----
curl -k -X GET -H "X-API-TOKEN: ...." 'https://rudderhost/rudder/api/latest/archives/export?rules=rule1,rule2&include=directives,techniques' -o archive.zip
----

And if you still need a specific group, directive or technique, or directive added in the archive, just add them in the query:

----
curl -k -X GET -H "X-API-TOKEN: ...." 'https://rudderhost/rudder/api/latest/archives/export?rules=...&directives=...&groups=...&techniques=...&include=directives,techniques' -o archive.zip
----


==== Extracting configuration items from a past revision

Finally, you can obtain an archive with configuration from a past revision. Just append the revision to the item id after a URL-encoded `+` (ie `%2B`) and its dependencies will be resolved for the same revision.

For example, for getting a rule and its dependencies from revision with commit ID `5962a856684ab8ce2363f302ed4ee9455786fd03`, use the command:

----
curl -k -X GET -H "X-API-TOKEN: ...." 'https://rudderhost/rudder/api/latest/archives/export?rules=2278f76f-28d3-4326-8199-99561dd8c785%2B5962a856684ab8ce2363f302ed4ee9455786fd03' -o archive.zip
----

=== Import configuration items


Import feature is very unsophisticated in that version. In particular, you need to know:
- that the archive format is expected to be the one from the export feature, bad serialization format will lead to errors,
- that configuration items with the same UUID as in the archive will be overwritten.

Once you're ready, importing an archive is done with that REST API call:

----
curl -k -X POST -H "X-API-TOKEN: ...." https://rudderhost/rudder/api/latest/archives/import --form "archive=@archive.zip"
----

Where `archive.zip` is the path toward your archive file.


=== Log information relative to archives processing server-side

Archives import/export feature has its own logger named `application.archive`.

You can get more information about what is happening in `/var/log/rudder/webapp/yyyy_MM_dd.stderrout.log` by adding the following logger definition in file
`/opt/rudder/etc/logback.xml` (no need to restart rudder after change) above lines `YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHANGE THINGS BELOW THAT LINE`:

----
  <logger name="application.archive" level="debug" />
----
