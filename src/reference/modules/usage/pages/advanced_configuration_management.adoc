== Policy generation

Each time a change occurs in the Rudder interface, having an impact on the
policy needed by a node, it is necessary to regenerate the modified
policies for every impacted node. By default this process is launched after each
change.

The process of policy generation:

* Use configured policies and information about the nodes to generate
  the files defining the policy that reflects the desired state
* Compute and store expected reports that will be produced when executing these policies
* Check the validity of the generated policies
* Replace the old version of the policies by the new one for impacted node
* Restart the policy server on the Rudder central server is authorizations have changed

You can customize some of these actions and add new ones using the xref:usage:advanced_configuration_management.adoc#_server_event_hooks[Server Event Hooks].

=== +Update policies+ button

The button +Update policies+ on the top right of the screen, in the +Status+ menu, allows you to force
the regeneration of the policies. As changes in the inventory of the nodes are
not automatically taken into account by Rudder, this feature can be useful
after some changes impacting the inventory information.

=== +Regenerate all policies+ button

The button *Regenerate all policies* on the top right of the screen, in the *Status* menu, allows you to force
the regeneration of all policies. It will clear all internal caches, and force a complete
computation of the policies. This is generally useful to make sure everything is correct after a problem
on the central server.

=== Policy generation info log

Policy generation is a complex process and it is central to Rudder use. You will often want to know more
about a policy generation result: what was the reason for a failure? What nodes where upated? Or even 
more specifics info like: where are info and debug log? 

==== /var/rudder/policy-generation-info

Directory `/var/rudder/policy-generation-info` contains information about the last policy generation(s)
in the following files:

- `last-failure-message`: when a generation fails, failure message is stored here. It is helpful for
  debugging purpose (for example when message is very long), or to know what happened in case of
  transient errors. 
- `last-updated-nodeids`: this file contains list of node updated in last generation. It is in a 
  source-able format which defined three bash array:
  - `RUDDER_UPDATED_POLICY_SERVER_IDS`: contains the set of updated policy servers (root or relay)
  - `RUDDER_UPDATED_NODE_IDS`: contains the set of updated standard nodes
  - `RUDDER_NODE_IDS`: contains both updated policy server and nodes. Policy servers always come first.

Each file starts with a comment describing what policy generation generated it. 
Two version of each of these files is concerved: the oldest one has a `.old` suffix.

==== `webapp` logs

Rudder web application logs located in `/var/log/rudder/webapp/yyyy_MM_dd.stderrout.log` contains information 
about policy generation process. In rudder 6.0, all policy generation logs are gathered under `policy.generation`
namespace (with optionally more precise namespace, like `policy.generation.timing` for timing information, or 
`policy.generation.update` for updated nodes, etc).
By default, policy generation logs when it starts with generic information about system: 

----

Much more information can be logged about policy generation (hook execution and timing, much more precise timing, 
updated nodes, files written, etc). All corresponding logs and verbosity levels are documented and controlled 
in `/opt/rudder/etc/logback.xml`.

== Understanding how Technique Editor works

In this chapter, we are giving an overview about how the Technique Editor works and how it is
integrated with the main Rudder application.

=== Directory layout

As explained in http://www.ncf.io/, ncf uses a structured directory tree composed of several layers of logic,
from internal libraries to Techniques and user services. All the files and logic in these folders will be named
"library" for simplicity

ncf directory structure exists in two root folders:

* `/usr/share/ncf/tree`
** This is the standard library installation folder. It is created and updated by the
   the ncf package. This folder will be completely overwritten when you update ncf
   package so you should never modify anything here: it will be lost at some point.

* `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf`
** This is were you add your own ncf Generic Methods and Techniques.
   Techniques created with the Technique Editor will be located here, and both
   Generic and Techniques in that place will be accessible in the Technique Editor
   alongside what is provided by the standard library.

=== Sharing ncf code with nodes

To share those folders to all nodes, Rudder makes a copy of these folders in two
places:

* `/var/rudder/ncf`, for part common to all nodes - so NOT techniques,
  ** `/var/rudder/ncf/local` is a copy of node-independent directories from
     `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf`, so almost everything *BUT*
     `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf/50_techniques`.
  ** `/var/rudder/ncf/common` is a copy `/usr/share/ncf/tree`
* `/var/rudder/share/xxxx-yyyy-node-id-zzzz/rules/cfengine-community/Technique_Name/1.0/Technique_Name.cf`
  for techniques, with one directory for each technique applied to the node.
* `/var/rudder/share/xxxx-yyyy-node-id-zzzz/rules/cfengine-community/rudder_expected_reports.csv`
  contains information about report expected for all ncf techniques applied to that node.

Files in `/var/rudder/ncf` are synchronized automatically by the "rudder agent update"
command when the agent runs on the server. So any modification done in files
in these directories will be lost at the next synchronization.

Files under `/var/rudder/share/` are updated during policy generation.

A node updates its ncf local library by copying the content of these two folders
during its policy update phase.

=== From ncf Technique Editor to Rudder Techniques and back

Here we will explain how the Technique Editor integration to Rudder is done to
transform ncf techniques into full fledged Rudder one. We will also get the
big picture of the web flow and the resulting events triggered on Rudder server
side.

Each action in the Technique Editor interface produces requests to an API defined over ncf.

All of the requests are authenticated thanks to a token passed in the JSESSIONID header.
The token is generated when an authenticated user is connected to the Rudder interface
(typically thanks to his browser).

That token is shared to the Technique Editor interface, which itself passes the
JSESSIONID header to all requests.

If you have authentication issue, check that your Rudder session is not expired.

Get request::

Get request will get all Techniques and Generic Methods in a path passed as parameters of the
request in the "path" javascript variable:

https://your.rudder.server/ncf-builder/#!?path=/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf

Get requests are triggered when accessing Technique editor.

The ncf API will parse all files in the parameter path by running "cf-promises -pjson" on all Techniques,
checking that all Techniques are correctly formed.

The ncf API will also look to all Generic Methods description data to build the catalog of available
Generic Methods.

The resulting information are sent back to the Technique Editor for displaying.

Post requests::

Post requests are issued when a Technique is created, modified or deleted.
They will only work on Techniques available in the path given in parameter.

They are triggered when clicking on save/delete button.

The main difference with get requests is that hooks are launched before and after the action is made.

We will see all hooks behavior in the following dedicated hooks section.

=== Hooks

On each POST request, pre- and post- hooks are executed by the Technique Editor.
These hooks are used for the Rudder integration to help transform pure ncf Techniques into Rudder one.

- pre-hooks are located in: `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf/pre-hooks.d`
- post-hooks are located in: `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf/post-hooks.d`

As of March 2015, we have two post-hooks defined and no pre-hooks:

* `post.write_technique.commit.sh`
** It commits the Technique newly created into Rudder Git configuration repository
located in `/var/rudder/configuration-repository`.
* `post.write_technique.rudderify.sh`
** It generates a valid Rudder Technique from a the newly created Technique and reloads Rudder
Technique Library so that updates are taken into account.

If you want to run post hooks by hand, you can use the following command:

      /var/rudder/configuration-repository/ncf/post-hooks.d/post.write_technique.commit.sh /var/rudder/configuration-repository bundle_name

[[_server_event_hooks]]
== Server Event Hooks

Rudder 4.1 introduces the possibility to execute files (hooks), typically scripts,
when some predefined event occurs on Rudder.

include::{partialsdir}/dyn/hooks.adoc[leveloffset=+3]


== New directives default naming scheme

When a new directive is created, by default the 'Name' field is filled
with the Technique name. For example, if you create a new Directive from
the 'Users' Technique, the Name field will get the value: "Users".

This not always what you want, especially for your custom Techniques. So you
have the possibility to define new default values for Name, at Technique or
at Technique and Version granularity.

This is done by adding or updating the file:
`/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques/default-directive-names.conf`.

That file need to be committed in git, and the Technique library reloaded
to take effect:

----
cd /var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques/
vi default-directive-names.conf
 ....
git add default-directive-names.conf
git commit -m "Change default names for new directives"
rudder server reload-techniques
----

The file format is a simple `techniqueId[/optionalVersion]: default name to use` format.
The Technique ID is the name of the directory containing the Technique version directory
in `/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques`.

For example, if we imagine that in your company, you have the internal
convention to create one directive by user role with the login in the
name, you would prefer to have a default value to:

----
Role <user-role>: <matching-login>
----

And then, for Users Technique version 7, you changed your mind and now
use the scheme:

----
Role: [user-role] (with login [login])
----

Then the file will look like:

----
# Default pattern for new directive from "userManagement" technique:
userManagement= Role <user-role>: <matching-login>

# For userManagement version 2.0, prefer that pattern in new Directives:
userManagement/7.0: Role: [user-role] (with login [login])
----


== Policies ordering

Configuration in Rudder is based on desired states, describing the expected state of the system, and not an ordered list of actions to run.
However, there are cases where having order is desirable (like ensuring that a JVM is present before deploying an Application server, or ensuring a user is present before setting it sudoers), even if it will converge over the course of several agent runs.

Rudder sorts the policies following this (best-effort) principle:

* Rules are executed in alphanumeric order
* Inside of a rule, directives are executed in alphanumeric order, except for:

** *Mono-instance* techniques: only one directive is selected and others are discarded (and they will be tagged as such in node detail compliance) 

*** the directive with the highest priority will be selected
*** in case of equal priorities, the rule name and then the directive name are used for sorting them (in alphanumeric order)

** *Limited multi-instance* techniques: all directives will be merged into *one* policy on the node

*** the merge order is based on priority, then rule name, and then directive name
*** the place of the merged policy itself in the global policies will be based on the rule and directive names of its most prioritary source directive

NOTE: The type of a technique is visible when clicking on the technique itself in the directives page.

.Best practice
[TIP]
=====
You should always start Rules and Directives name by 2 (or 3) digits to be able to easily reorder Policy evaluation if the need happen:

Do not use: "My general security rule" and "Check ssh configuration"

But use: "05. My general security rule" and "40. Check ssh configuration"
=====

=== Example

- given three Techniques A, B and C
- directives A1 and A2 based on Technique A, directives B1 and B2 based on B, directives C1 and C2 based on C
- all Directives have the same priority,
- rule R0 having [C1], R1 having [A1, B2] and rule R2 having [A2, B1, C2], all applied on a same node,
- merging (R0, C1) and (R2, C2) => [C1, C2] and keep (R0, C1) as Policy order
- merging (R1, A1) and (R2, A2) => [A1, A2] and keep (R1, A1) as Policy order,
- merging (R1, B2) and (R2, B1) => [B2, B1] (because R1 < R2) and keep (R1, B2) for policy order,
- so policies are sort: (R0, C1) then (R1, A1) then (R1, B2)
- resulting ordering of directive's values will be: [C1, C2] then [A1, A2] then [B1, B2]

== Share files between nodes

Rudder 4.1 introduced a way to share files from one node to another.
It allows a node to send a file to its relay, which will make it available
for another target node, that has to to specifically download it.

This file sharing method is secured by:

* The control of uploaded file signature by the server, to check it matches the source node's private key.
* The same mechanism as standard file copy in Rudder to download the shared file from the server.

It also includes a ttl mechanism that allows sharing a file for a limited amount of time.

To use this feature, two generic methods are available in the technique editor:

* xref:reference:generic_methods.adoc#sharedfile_from_node[sharedfile_from_node]: To download a file shared from another node.
* xref:reference:generic_methods.adoc#sharedfile_to_node[sharedfile_to_node]: To make a file available to another node.

See the documentation of these methods for details about the required parameters,
and especially xref:reference:generic_methods.adoc#sharedfile_to_node[sharedfile_to_node] for a complete usage example.
