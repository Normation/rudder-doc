== Building the Rudder agent

=== Get source

Make sure you have network access and the git command. Also make sure
you have all prerequisites installed. If later on you see "Warning:
prerequisite (something) not found" in the build log, go back and make
sure to install the missing software before using the resulting
package.

Go to your build directory and checkout rudder-packages

----

cd /usr/src
git clone https://github.com/Normation/rudder-packages.git
cd rudder-packages

----

Choose the branch to build

----

# For branch 5.0
git checkout branches/rudder/5.0
cd rudder-agent

----

Now choose one of the 3 next chapter, depending on your case: dpkg (debian-like package), rpm (redhat-like package) or other.

=== Build a dpkg package

Set the version to build:

* Update the `debian/changelog` file to make the first entry match the version you want to build.
* Edit the SOURCES/Makefile file and set the value of `RUDDER_VERSION_TO_PACKAGE`: see https://repository.rudder.io/sources/ for a complete list of available versions.

Run the dpkg package builder:

----

dpkg-buildpackage

----

The package will be stored in the parent directory.

=== Build an rpm package

Set the version to build:

* Edit the SOURCES/Makefile file and set the value of `RUDDER_VERSION_TO_PACKAGE`: see https://repository.rudder.io/sources/ for a complete list of available versions.

Run the rpm package builder:

----

# make sure you are in in rudder-agent, then
ln -s `pwd` /root/rpmbuild
rpmbuild -ba --define 'real_version 5.0.0' SPECS/*.spec

----

The package will be stored in `RPMS/`.

=== Build an agent locally

Before building the agent, you must decide on some environment variables:


* `RUDDER_VERSION_TO_PACKAGE`: the version of the sources that will be used, see https://repository.rudder.io/sources/ for a complete list. If a `rudder-sources` directory exists in `SOURCES` it will be used instead of downloading sources. The Variable still needs to be defined though.

* `DESTDIR`: where to put the installation, use/to install on the system and leave the default of ./target to prepare a package.

* `USE_SYSTEM_OPENSSL`: (default true), use system openssl (depends on libssl-dev) or build it with the agent.

* `USE_SYSTEM_LMDB`: (default false), use system lmdb (depends on liblmdb-dev) or build it with the agent.

* `USE_SYSTEM_PCRE`: (default true), use system pcre (depends on libpcre3-dev) or build it with the agent.

* `USE_SYSTEM_PERL`: (default false), use system perl (depends on perl) or build it with the agent.

* `USE_SYSTEM_FUSION`: (default false), use system fusion (depends on fusioninventory-agent), or build it with the agent. We advise you to use the Rudder version since it contains some patches.

# example
env="RUDDER_VERSION_TO_PACKAGE=5.0.0 DESTDIR=/ USE_SYSTEM_PERL=true"
make $env
make install $env
