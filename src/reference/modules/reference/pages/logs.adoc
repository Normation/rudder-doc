=== Webapp

All web application logs are located under the `webapp` folder. A new log file is generated everytime the service `rudder-jetty` is restarted.
If you want to access the current webapp logs, look for the file named `<today's date>.stderrout.log`.
The `java.log` is used to log the JVM errors.

=== Apache2

The `apache2` folder is mostly used to log inventories and API calls.

=== Reports

Only active when using the `SYSLOG` reporting mode and enabled in the webapp settings, it aggregates all raw
reports received from the nodes under the file `/var/log/rudder/reports/all.log`.

=== Compliance

The `compliance` folder will aggregate by default all non `Success` or `N/A` reports under `/var/log/rudder/compliance/non-compliant-reports.log`
One line per reports that is neither `Success` nor `N/A`, as described below:
