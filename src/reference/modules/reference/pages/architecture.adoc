= Rudder architecture

== Inventory workflow, from nodes to Root server

One of the main information workflow in a Rudder managed system is the node's
inventory one.

Node inventories are generated on nodes, are sent to the node policy server (be
it a Relay or the Root server) up to the Root server, and stored in the
Rudder database (technically an LDAP server), waiting for later use.

The goal of that section is to detail the different steps and explain how to
spot and solve a problem on the inventory workflow. Following diagram sum up
the whole process.

Root server]


=== Processing inventories on node

Inventories are generated daily during an agent run in the 00:00-06:00 time
frame window local to the node. The exact time is randomly spread on the time
frame for a set of nodes, but each node will always keep the same time (modulo
the exact time of the run).

User can request the generation and upload of inventory with the command:

----

rudder agent inventory

----

In details, generating inventory does:

* ask the node policy server for its UUID with an HTTP GET on
  `https://server/uuid`,
* generate an inventory by scanning the node hardware and software components,
* make a digital signature of the generated inventory file,
* send file(s) to the node's policy server on `https://POLICY-SERVER/inventory-updates/`

The individual commands can be displayed with the `-i` option to `rudder agent
inventory` command.


=== Processing inventories on relays

On the Relay server:

* the inventory and its signature are received by a `webdav` endpoint,
* the `webdav` service store the files in the folder
  `/var/rudder/inventories/incoming`
* on each agent runs, files in `/var/rudder/inventories/incoming` are
  forwarded to the Relay own policy server.

=== Processing inventories on root server

On the Root server, the start of the workflow is the same than on a relay:

* the inventory is received by a `webdav` endpoint,
* the `webdav` service store the file in the folder
  `/var/rudder/inventories/incoming` (for nodes not already accepted in Rudder)
  or in `/var/rudder/inventories/accepted-nodes-updates` (for node already
  accepted).

As soon as a file is created or modified in these two directories, an `inotify`
event is sent to in inventory watcher process which:

- check if the file is of any interest for it based on extension (`.ocs`,
  `.xml`, `.gz`, `.sign` extension are processed)
- if the file is an archive, it's extracted,
- if the file is a signature (respectively an inventory), it waits for the
  corresponding inventory (respectively signature) for up to 10s,
- if only the signature is present, nothing is done (only a log),
- if only the inventory file is present, the processing is done in
  "compatibility" mode to support rudder agent below version 5.0,
- if the pair is present, both are processed together.
- processing starts by parsing inventory file and check for mandatory
  elements (especially `<RUDDER>` tag and content)
- then, inventory is queued to be saved in LDAP.

=== Queue of inventories waiting to be parsed

The _inventory endpoint_ has a limited number of slot available for successfully
uploaded inventories to be queued waiting for parsing.
That number can be configured in file `/opt/rudder/etc/inventory-web.properties`:

----

waiting.inventory.queue.size=50

----

The number of currently waiting
inventories can be obtained via a local REST API call to
`http://localhost:8080/endpoint/api/info`:

----

$ curl http://localhost:8080/endpoint/api/info

{
  "queueMaxSize": 50,
  "queueFillCount": 50,
  "queueSaturated": true
}

----


=== Start, stop, restart inventory watchers

Inventory `inotify` watcher can be controlled via local REST API call:

.start watchers
----

$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/endpoint/api/watcher/start

----


.restart watchers
----

$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/endpoint/api/watcher/restart

----


.stop watchers
----

$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/endpoint/api/watcher/stop

----


== Rudder Server data workflow

To have a better understanding of the Archive feature of Rudder, a description
of the data workflow can be useful.

All the logic of Rudder Techniques is stored on the filesystem in
+/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques+.
The files are under version control, using git.
The tree is organized as following:

. At the first level, techniques are classified in categories: applications,
fileConfiguration, fileDistribution,  jobScheduling,  system,  systemSettings.
The description of the category is included in +category.xml+.

. At the second and third level, Technique identifier and version.

. At the last level, each technique is described with a +metadata.xml+ file and
one or several agent template files (name ending with +.st+).

----

At Rudder Server startup, or after the user has requested a reload of the
Rudder Techniques, each +metadata.xml+ is mapped in memory, and used to create
the LDAP subtree of Active Techniques.
The LDAP tree contains also a set of subtrees for Node Groups, Rules and Node
Configurations.

At each change of the Node Configurations, Rudder Server generates the agent policies for the Nodes.

== Rudder agent workflow

[NOTE]

.Components

=====

This agent contains the following tools:

. The community version of http://www.cfengine.com[CFEngine], a powerful open
source configuration management tool.

. http://fusioninventory.org/[FusionInventory], an inventory software.

. An initial configuration set for the agent, to bootstrap the Rudder Root Server
access.

These components are recognized for their reliability and minimal impact on
performances. Our tests showed their memory consumption is usually under 10 MB
of RAM during their execution. So you can safely install them on your servers.

We grouped all these tools in one package, to ease the Rudder Agent
installation.

=====

In this chapter, we will have a more detailed view of the Rudder Agent
workflow. What files and processes are created or modified at the installation
of the Rudder Agent? What is happening when a new Node is created? What are the
recurrent tasks performed by the Rudder Agent? How does the Rudder Server handle
the requests coming from the Rudder Agent? The Rudder Agent workflow diagram
summarizes the process that will be described in the next pages.

image::graphviz/agent_workflow.png[Rudder agent workflow]

Let's consider the Rudder Agent is installed and configured on the new Node.

The Rudder Agent is regularly launched and performs following tasks
sequentially, in this order:

=== Request data from Rudder Server

The agent tries to fetch new Applied Policies from Rudder Server. Only
requests from valid Nodes will be accepted. At first run and until the Node has
been validated in Rudder, this step fails.

=== Launch processes

Ensure that the agent daemons +cf-execd+ and +cf-serverd+ are
running. Try to start these daemons if they are not already started.

Add a line in +/etc/crontab+ to launch +cf-execd+ if it's not running.

Ensure again that the agent daemons +cf-execd+ and +cf-serverd+
are running. Try to start these daemons if they are not already started.

=== Identify Rudder Root Server

Ensure the +curl+ package is installed. Install the package if it's not
present.

Get the identifier of the Rudder Root Server, necessary to generate reports.
The URL of the identifier is http://Rudder_root_server/uuid

=== Inventory

If no inventory has been sent since 8 hours, or if a forced inventory has been
requested (class +force_inventory+ is defined), do and send an inventory to the
server.
----

rudder agent inventory

----

No reports are generated until the Node has been validated in Rudder Server.

=== Apply Directives

Apply other policies and write reports locally.

== Configuration files for a Node

* `/etc/default/rudder-agent`

== Packages organization

=== Packages

Rudder components are distributed as a set of packages.

+rudder-server+::

Main package for the Rudder server.
It includes :
* the graphical interface for Rudder
* the inventory reception service
* the application server (namely jetty), it depends on a compatible Java 11 Runtime Environment
* the Techniques (installed into +/opt/rudder/share/techniques+)
* the database containing the inventory and configuration information (namely OpenLDAP)
* the database script and dependency to store logs using the 'PostgreSQL' engine of the distribution

+rudder-api-client+::

Package that contains a command line to access the Rudder server API and a library to access it from python.

+rudder-relay+::

Package to setup a Rudder relay. It must be installed on a system that should be used as relays.

+rudder-agent+::

One single package integrates everything needed for the Rudder Agent. It
contains CFEngine Community, FusionInventory.

The +rudder-agent+ package mays either depends on or embed a few libraries and utilities depending on their existence within the target distribution.
