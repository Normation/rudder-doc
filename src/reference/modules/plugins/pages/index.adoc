= Manage plugins

Rudder is an extensible software. The *Plugins*
menu sums-up information about loaded plugins, their version and their
configuration. There are two types of Rudder pre-packaged plugins:

* Integration plugins, that allow linking Rudder to other tools (monitoring, inventory, notification, etc.). They are freely available.
* Advanced features plugins (reporting, validation workflow, etc.) which are part of the Rudder subscription.

You can download free plugins https://repository.rudder.io/plugins/[on repository.rudder.io] or get information about plugins included in the subscription the https://www.rudder.io/software/features/[dedicated page on rudder.io].

== Install plugins with a subscription

First, you need to configure your Rudder technical account (username and password)
There are two ways to do it:

- Using the web interface in *Administration -> Setup*

- By editing the configuration file `/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-pkg/rudder-pkg.conf` where you can also define proxy information if your Rudder server need to get
 through a proxy to download plugins, keep the values empty if you don't need them (no proxy or no authentication).

Plugin management uses the `rudder package` command.
Start by updating the repository index and your licenses:

----
rudder package update
----

List available packages:

----
rudder package list --all
----

You can then install plugins with:

----
rudder package install <plugin_name>
rudder package install <plugin_name_1> <plugin_name_2>
----

The application will restart if necessary. Please read install output carefully as some
plugins require additional dependencies.

To update a plugin, refresh repository index with `rudder package update` and run:

----
rudder package upgrade <plugin_name>
----

If your server is configured to use the Rudder plugin repository, a daily job will automatically
update your plugin index and licenses.
If is fails or your server can't reach the repository, when one or more licenses come close to expiration,
an alert will appear in Rudder's menu bar when a license is close to expiration.

== Manual plugins installation

Plugin management uses the `rudder package` command.
You need to download the `.rpkg` package file of the plugin on your Rudder server,
then install it with:

----
rudder package install <package.rpkg>
----

To update a plugin, you need to reinstall it with the same command, but in the newer version.
If the plugin requires a license, you can enable it by putting your `license.key` and `.license` files under:

----
/opt/rudder/etc/plugins/licenses/
----

== More about plugins

A plugin is an `.rpkg` file (for "Rudder package"), see the xref:reference:plugin_format.adoc[dedicated documentation] for more
information about the format.

You can get information about available plugins with:

----
# List currently installed plugins
rudder package list
# List currently available plugins
rudder package list --all
# Display details of a plugin
rudder package show <package_name>
----

You can manage installed plugins with:

----

----
