= Manage plugins

Rudder is an extensible software. There is a dedicated *Plugins* page for listing available plugins, installing and managing plugins. There are two types of Rudder pre-packaged plugins:

* Integration plugins, that allow linking Rudder to other tools (monitoring, inventory, notification, etc.). They are freely available.
* Feature-enhancing plugins (patch management, OIDC/LDAP login, validation workflow, etc.) which are provided under license after the setup of your Rudder account.

You can download free plugins https://repository.rudder.io/plugins/[on repository.rudder.io] or get information about plugins included with your Rudder account and subscription https://www.rudder.io/software/features/[on the Rudder website].

== Basic plugin management via UI

To manage plugins through the Rudder web interface, navigate to *Administration -> Plugins*.
From this page, you can list plugins from the repository, and search for plugins to install. Other actions such as upgrading, enabling, disabling, and uninstalling plugins are also available.

=== Account setup for plugin licensing

Before installing plugins, ensure your Rudder server is setup with a technical account, which _username_ is the same as the licensee ID used for verifying the plugin licenses.
If the account is not yet setup, the Plugins page will have a warning with a link to the page to setup the account :

The setup and advanced configuration values are also available, see the details in the <<advanced_plugin_management,Advanced plugin management>> section.
After the successful setup of the plugins page, a summary of the license information of plugins will be displayed at the top of the Plugins page :

=== Plugins management
For installing or upgrading plugins, search for the relevant plugins, then select the plugins and click on the action button. A confirmation page will appear, and Rudder will restart if necessary to load the new plugins.

=== Technical account configuration

The technical account can be edited from the configuration file `/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-pkg/rudder-pkg.conf`, and you can also define proxy information if your Rudder server needs to get through a proxy to download plugins. Keep the values empty if you don't need them (no proxy or no authentication).

=== Plugin installation and management

Plugin management in the command line involves using the `rudder package` command.

Start by updating the repository index and your licenses:

----
rudder package update
----

List available packages:

----
rudder package list --all
----

You can then install plugins with:

----
rudder package install <plugin_name>
rudder package install <plugin_name_1> <plugin_name_2>
----

The application will restart if necessary. Please read the install output carefully as some plugins require additional dependencies.

To update a plugin, refresh the repository index with `rudder package update` and run:

----
rudder package upgrade <plugin_name>
----

If your server is configured to use the Rudder plugin repository, a daily job will automatically
update your plugin index and licenses.
If is fails or your server can't reach the repository, when one or more licenses come close to expiration,
an alert will appear in Rudder's menu bar.

=== Manual plugins installation

If you have downloaded the `.rpkg` package file of the plugin on your Rudder server, you can install it offline with :

----
rudder package install <package.rpkg>
----

To update the plugin, you need to reinstall it with the same command, but in the newer version.
If the plugin requires a license, you can enable it by putting your `license.key` and `.license` files under:

----
/opt/rudder/etc/plugins/licenses/
----

=== More about plugins

A plugin is an `.rpkg` file (for "Rudder package"), see the xref:reference:plugin_format.adoc[dedicated documentation] for more
information about the format.

You can get information about available plugins with:

----
# List currently installed plugins
rudder package list
# List currently available plugins
rudder package list --all
# Display details of a plugin
rudder package show <package_name>
----

You can manage installed plugins with:

----
rudder package enable <plugin>
rudder package disable <plugin>
rudder package remove <package>
----

See all available commands with:

----
rudder package --help
