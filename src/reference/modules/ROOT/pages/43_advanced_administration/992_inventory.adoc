=== Use Rudder inventory in other tools

Rudder centralizes the information about your managed systems, and
you can use this information in other tools, mainly through the API.
We well here give a few examples.

==== Export to a spreadsheet

You can export the list of your nodes to a spreadsheet file (xls format) by using a
https://github.com/normation/rudder-tools/tree/master/contrib/rudder_nodes_list[tool] available in the rudder-tools repository.

Simple follow the installation instructions, and run it against your Rudder server.
You will get a file containing:

You can easily modify the script to add other information.

==== Rundeck and Ansible

There are plugins for Rundeck and Ansible that can be used with each tool to make
them aware of inventory data from Rudder. For more information, see details in
the xref:80_extension_and_integration/40_Rudder_Integration.adoc#rudder-integration[Third party integration with Rudder]
paragraph.
