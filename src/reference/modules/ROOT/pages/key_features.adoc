== OS independent target configuration state definition

Rudder is able to adapt to complex process and only do the minimal required
work so that the server converges to the desired state, and so whatever was the
starting state point. Rudder works as a GPS would, adapting the path to your
destination depending of the path you actually took. This process is much more
resilient to changes than a step by step, procedural description of the commands
to execute.

Rudder is natively integrated with the supported OS (Linux, Windows - see
xref:installation:operating_systems.adoc#node-supported-os[the list of supported Operating Systems for Nodes]) so that it provides generic, abstract, OS independent
primitives to the user who can:


* install software in OS native packaging system (RPM on RHEL, Windows software
  components, or even direct install from sources),
* configure OS level parameters and services like logs, DNS, NTP, etc.
* create and maintain user accounts (administrator accesses, developers) and
  groups with a transparent support of OS specific requirements on file format,
  password hashes algorithms, etc for any supported OS.
* build an hardened system by configuring and then continuously verifying the
  correct set-up of security rules like file system rights, file integrity
  checking, etc.
* configure middleware by files (for example in Linux world, whatever the file
  format, and be it from a template or by only specifying enforcement of some
  configuration parameters) or thanks to the Windows Registry,
* manage service start-up at boot time and ensure that a service is correctly
  running at any time, starting it up again if needed.

The simple primitives can be simply mixed and xref:ROOT:key_features.adoc#intro-rudder-extensibility[extended] to provide
solutions for any and all of your unique use cases of software stacks,
deployments, IT services or configuration that can't be natively supported.

== Centralize and aggregate real configuration states

The nominal working mode of Rudder is a **continuous verification** mode, which
makes Rudder manage the whole application life cycle and check that configurations
remain valid at any time.

image::introduction/general_behavior_workflow.png["Define target, check, report, remediate", align="center"]

Rudder can also *continuously check* that rules are valid and *proactively* correct
any drift from the desired application state when needed. A *graphical reporting*
displays what happened and when.

image::introduction/rules_compliance.png[Rules compliance reporting]

Rudder can notify the ops team about a drift from the desired configuration state.
Understanding what the problem is is made simpler by the graphical reporting
which allows to drill down toward the technical root cause and see in a blink
where the drift comes from.

== Automatic inventory

Rudder automatically does a technical, detailed inventory of the servers on
which the agent is installed.
That inventory contains hardware information (like server kind, CPU, RAM,
hard drives, etc), networks information (network interface and configuration),
OS level data (OS type and name, version and patch level, etc) and software
information (installed software with their versions).

This information are available in Rudder configuration data base and can be
used to defined configuration rule targets. Typically, some configurations are
linked to the kind of server (physical or virtual), the quantity of RAM
available, the version of an OS library which contains a security bug, etc.

All of these data are also available xref:administration:integration.adoc#rudder-api-integration[through Rudder APIs].

== REST API

All Rudder commands are available through an exhaustive REST API. That API is
https://docs.rudder.io/api/[fully documented online] and can
be used to xref:administration:integration.adoc#rudder-api-integration[quickly and smoothly integrate Rudder with your existing infrastructure].

== Audit trace and Change Requests

Any change done thanks to Rudder in your infrastructure is automatically
recorded in an *Audit Log* which allows a full traceability of all changes.
That feature also allows rollbacks of the recorded change.

image::introduction/audit_trace.png["Trace events and display changes", align="center"]

All changes can be forced to go through a peer review or validation step and
so be part of a conformity process.

image::introduction/change_request.png["Change Request", align="center"]

The validation process can be externalized to third party ticketing system, like
a CMDB, so that it can integrated into an existing company workflow. This
integration is done thanks to xref:TODO[an existing
plugin or a dedicated synchronisation tool].

== Centralized authentication (LDAP, Active Directory, OpenID Connect)

By default, Rudder uses a dedicated configuration file to manage user credentials. 
Thanks to the xref:plugins:auth-backends.adoc[authentication backends plugin], 
Rudder can use a centralized authentication provider, like enterprise directories
(LDAP, Active Directory) or an SSO via OpenID Connect (OIDC).

[[intro-rudder-extensibility]]
== Extensibility

Rudder has a built-in library of common software components and configuration.
But of course, your infrastructure is not limited to that handful of standard
components and that's why Rudder was made to be extremely simply extended so
that it can manage services, process or software specific to your company and
your workflows.

To achieve that goal, Rudder provided a big set of OS independent and generic,
unitary modules. Rudder agent is able to translate these abstract modules to
native OS specific commands and configurations.

Modules are atomic tasks, that can be extremely simple (for example, check the
existence of a file, create an user or a group, update a software package) or
more complex (for example, import JSON data from a REST API).
For information, the following image provides a NON-exhaustive list of
available modules:

image::introduction/generic_methods_list.png["Non exhaustive list of generic methods", align="center"]

These generic, unitary modules can be used to build new higher level,
OS independent, parameterizable configuration modules. By combining these module,
you are able to manage any configuration and build advanced configuration
policies for your IT services:

image::introduction/rule_directive_generic_method_stack.png["Build your own configuration, matching your requirements", align="center"]

The unitary configuration modules can be configured thanks to a high level
programming language:

image::introduction/ncf_language.png["High level definition language", align="center"]

But the *natural*, *common* strategy to use them is with the xref:usage:technique_editor.adoc#technique-editor["provided graphical editor"]
which allows to use all the same modules, but with a *web UI* and
with *drag'n'drop*. Of course, you can configure each unitary module to use data from
a node and behave specifically on each one.
