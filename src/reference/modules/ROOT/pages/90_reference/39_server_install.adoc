==== Packages

Rudder components are distributed as a set of packages.

+rudder-webapp+::

Package for the Rudder Web Application. It is the graphical interface for
Rudder.

+rudder-inventory-endpoint+::

Package for the inventory reception service. It has no graphical interface. This
service is using HTTP as transport protocol. It receives an parses the files
sent by FusionInventory and insert the valuable data into the LDAP database.

+rudder-jetty+::

Application server for +rudder-webapp+ and +rudder-inventory-endpoint+. Both
packages are written in 'Scala'. At compilation time, they are converted into
+.war+ files. They need to be run in an application server. 'Jetty' is this
application server. It depends on a compatible Java 8 Runtime Environment.

+rudder-techniquess+::

Package for the Techniques. They are installed in
+/opt/rudder/share/techniques+. At runtime, the Techniques are
copied into a 'git' repository in +/var/rudder/configuration-repository+. Therefore, the package depends
on the +git+ package.

+rudder-inventory-ldap+::

Package for the database containing the inventory and configuration information
for each pending and validated Node. This 'LDAP' database is build upon
'OpenLDAP' server.  The 'OpenLDAP' engine is contained in the package.

+rudder-reports+::

Package for the database containing the logs sent by each Node and the reports
computed by Rudder. This is a 'PostgreSQL' database using the 'PostgreSQL'
engine of the distribution. The package has a dependency on the +postgresl+
package, creates the database named +rudder+ and installs the inialisation
scripts for that database in +/opt/rudder/etc/postgresql/*.sql+.

+rudder-server-root+::

Package to ease installation of all Rudder services. This package depends on
all above packages. It also 

- installs the Rudder configuration script:

----

/opt/rudder/bin/rudder-init

----

- installs the initial promises for the Root Server in:

----

/opt/rudder/share/initial-promises/

----

- installs the init scripts (and associated +default+ file):

----

/etc/init.d/rudder

----

- installs the logrotate configuration:

----

/etc/logrotate.d/rudder-server-root

----

+rudder-agent+::

One single package integrates everything needed for the Rudder Agent. It
contains CFEngine Commmunity, FusionInventory, and the initial promises for a
Node. It also contains an init script:

----

/etc/init.d/rudder 

----

The +rudder-agent+ package depends on a few libraries and utilities:

* +OpenSSL+
* +libpcre+
* +liblmdb+ (On platforms where it is available as a package - on others the rudder-agent package bundles it)
* +uuidgen+

==== Software dependencies and third party components

The Rudder Web application requires the installation of 'Apache 2 httpd',
'JRE 7+', and 'cURL'; the LDAP Inventory service needs 'rsyslog' and
the report service requires 'PostgreSQL'.

When available, packages from your distribution are used. These packages are:

Apache::

The Apache Web server is used as a proxy to give HTTP access to the Web
Application. It is also used to give writable WebDAV access for the inventory.
The Nodes send their inventory to the WebDAV service, the inventory is stored in
+/var/rudder/inventories/incoming+.

PostgreSQL::

The PostgreSQL database is used to store logs sent by the Nodes and
reports generated by Rudder. Rudder 4.0 is tested for PostgreSQL 9.2 and higher. It still works with version 8.4 to 9.1, but not warranties are made that it will hold in the future. It is really recommanded to migrate to PostgreSQL 9.2 at least.

rsyslog and rsyslog-pgsql::

The rsyslog server is receiving the logs from the nodes and insert them into a
PostgreSQL database. On SLES, the +rsyslog-pgsql+ package is not part of the
distribution, it can be downloaded alongside Rudder packages.

Java 8+ JRE::

The Java runtime is needed by the Jetty application server. Where possible, the
package from the distribution is used, else a Java RE must be downloaded
from Oracle's website (http://www.java.com).

curl::

This package is used to send inventory files from
+/var/rudder/inventories/incoming+ to the Rudder Endpoint.

git::

The running Techniques Library is maintained as a git repository in
+/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques+.
