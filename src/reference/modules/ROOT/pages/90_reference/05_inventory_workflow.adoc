=== Inventory workflow, from nodes to Root server

One of the main information workflow in a Rudder managed system is the node's
inventory one.

Node inventories are generated on nodes, are sent to the node policy server (be
it a Relay or the Root server) up to the Root server, and stored in the
Rudder database (technically an LDAP server), waiting for later use.

The goal of that section is to detail the different steps and explain how to
spot and solve a problem on the inventory workflow. Following diagram sum up
the whole process.

==== Processing inventories on node

Inventories are generated daily during an agent run in the 00:00-06:00 time
frame window local to the node. The exact time is randomly spread on the time
frame for a set of nodes, but each node will always keep the same time (modulo
the exact time of the run).

User can request the generation and upload of inventory with the command:

----

$ rudder agent inventory

----

In details, generating inventory does:

* ask the node policy server for its UUID with an HTTP GET on
  `https://server/uuid`,
* generate an inventory by scanning the node hardware and software components,
* optionally make a digital signature of the generated inventory file,
* send file(s) to the node's policy server on `https://POLICY-SERVER/inventory-updates/`

The individual commands can be displayed with the `-i` option to `rudder agent
inventory` command.


==== Processing inventories on relays

On the Relay server:

* the inventory is received by a `webdav` endpoint,
* the `webdav` service store the file in the folder
  `/var/rudder/inventories/incoming`
* on each agent runs, files in `/var/rudder/inventories/incoming` are
  forwarded to the Relay own policy server.

==== Processing inventories on root server

On the Root server, the start of the workflow is the same than on a relay:

* the inventory is received by a `webdav` endpoint,
* the `webdav` service store the file in the folder
  `/var/rudder/inventories/incoming`

Then, on each run, the agent:

* look for inventory / signature pairs:
** inventories without a corresponding signature file are processed only if
   they are older than 2 minutes,
* POST the inventory or inventory+signature pair to the local API of
  "inventory-endpoint" application on `http://localhost:8080/endpoint/upload/`
* the API makes some quick checks on inventory (well formed, mandatory fields...)
  and :
** if checks are OK, *ACCEPTS* (HTTP code `200`) the inventory,
** if signature is configured to be mandatory and is missing, or if the
   signature is not valid, refuses with *UNAUTHORIZED* error (HTTP code `401`)
** else fails with a *PRECONDITION FAILED* error (HTTP code `412`)
* on error, inventory file is moved to `/var/rudder/inventories/failed`,
* on success:
** the inventory file is moved to `/var/rudder/inventories/received`,
** in parallel, _inventory web_ parses and updates Rudder database.

==== Queue of inventories waiting to be parsed

The _inventory endpoint_ has a limited number of slot available for succesfully
uploaded inventories to be queued waiting for parsing.
That number can be configured in file `/opt/rudder/etc/inventory-web.properties`:

----

waiting.inventory.queue.size=50

----

Number of currently waiting inventories can be obtained via a local REST API call to
`http://localhost:8080/endpoint/api/info`:

----

$ curl http://localhost:8080/endpoint/api/info

{
  "queueMaxSize": 50,
  "queueFillCount": 50,
  "queueSaturated": true
}
