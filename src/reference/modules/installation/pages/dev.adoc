= Development versions

[WARNING]

====

Development versions *should not* be used on production, but only on test systems.
In particular, there is no guaranteed upgrade path for any development version.

====

We provide different kinds of development versions:

* *nightly builds* of every maintained branch on all supported operating systems
* *pre-release* cycle before new versions:

** *alpha* which are actually nightly builds and never released
** *beta* releases
** *rc* releases

The best way to help us improve a future release is to test the beta and rc packages, and to
provide feedback:

* Report bugs on https://issues.rudder.io[our bug tracker]
* Discuss problems or possible improvements in https://chat.rudder.io[out chat room]

To get the full list of repository URLs, go
to https://docs.rudder.io/versions[the page presenting Rudder versions].

You can then follow standard install documentation, you only need to replace
the repostory URLs by the nightly/beta/rc ones.
