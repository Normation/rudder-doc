= Install Rudder server with an external database

Rudder uses a PostgreSQL database to store its reports.

People having a dedicated database server or having a report database becoming too big can setup an external database instead of letting Rudder manage one on the Rudder server itself.

== Install a new server with a separate database

[[install-postgresql]]
=== Install PostgreSQL server

If you have to install the PostgreSQL service on a separate server, we provide here a simplified PostgreSQL documentation.

If your organization has a database administrator, just ask him to create a new database with an associated user and permissions.

If in doubt, please always refer to the officiel PostgreSQL documentation https://www.postgresql.org/docs/
Check that you have the minimum required PostgreSQL version and install it.

[WARNING]

====

Rudder requires PostgreSQL 10.3 or higher.

====

On a RHEL-like system

----

$ yum install postgresql-server
$ postgresql-setup --initdb
$ systemctl start postgresql


----

On a Debian-like system

----

$ apt-get install postgresql

----


On a SLES system

----

$ zypper install postgresql-server
$ systemctl start postgresql

----

Then, you need to create the `rudder` user with a secure password, and then the `rudder` database

----

$ su postgres -c "psql -q -c \"CREATE USER rudder WITH PASSWORD '${PASSWORD}'\""

$ su postgres -c "psql -q -c 'CREATE DATABASE rudder WITH OWNER = rudder'"

----

Make sure to give access to this user from the outside by editing `pg_hba.conf`.

On debian like it is `/etc/postgresql/<your version>/main/pg_hba.conf`, on redhat like it is `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf`.

In any case, it can be found with the command : Ì€ su postgres -c "psql -t -P format=unaligned -c 'show hba_file';"`

----

# this line must be adapted to you installation and put into pg_hba.conf
# host  <database>         <user>          <rudder server IP>/32       md5
host    rudder             rudder          196.168.0.1/32           md5

----

Make sure your postgresql server listens on a public interface. In `postgresql.conf`.

On debian like it is `/etc/postgresql/<your version>/main/postgresql.conf`, on redhat like it is `/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf`.

In any case, it should be in the same directory as `pg_hba.conf`.

----

listen_addresses = '*'

----

Finally restart PostgreSQL service:

----

systemctl restart postgresql

----

=== Install rudder-external-db

On Rudder host, first install the `rudder-external-db` package, before installing any rudder package:


On a RHEL-like system

----

$ yum install rudder-external-db

----

On a Debian-like system

----

$ apt-get install rudder-external-db

----

On a SLES system

----

$ zypper install rudder-external-db

----

You need to complete the configuration file `/opt/rudder/etc/external-db.conf`:

----

# Host where rudder server must connect to access the database
DB_HOST="postgresql.example.com"

# Database user and password, to create them ask your database administrator or use the following command
#    su postgres -c "psql -q -c \"CREATE USER ${DB_USER} WITH PASSWORD '${DB_PASSWORD}'\""
DB_USER="rudder"
DB_PASSWORD="xxx"

# Postgresql database name, to create it ask your database administrator or use the following command
#    su postgres -c "psql -q -c \"CREATE DATABASE ${DB_NAME} WITH OWNER = ${DB_USER}\""
DB_NAME="rudder"

----

And check that you can connect to the database server

----

psql -U rudder -h $DB_HOST

----

=== Install Rudder

Finally follow the regular Rudder server installation process depending on your system: xref:installation:server/debian.adoc[Debian/Ubuntu] | xref:installation:server/rhel.adoc[RHEL/CentOS/AlmaLinux/Rocky] | xref:installation:server/sles.adoc[SLES] | xref:installation:server/rhel7.adoc[Amazon Linux 2]
