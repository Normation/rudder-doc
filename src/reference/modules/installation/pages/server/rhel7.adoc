= Install Rudder root server on Amazon Linux 2

Amazon Linux 2 is derived from RHEL 7.

Base RHEL 7 is not supported anymore because of missing components, but Amazon Linux 2
provides amazon-linux-extras that contains missing parts.

To install a Rudder Server on Amazon Linux 2 you first need a support access to
Rudder downloads with RHEL 7 server access.

Then make sure amazon-linux-extras is installed:

----

which amazon-linux-extras

----

If it is not installed, install it:

----

sudo yum install -y amazon-linux-extras

----

Finally you need postgresql 9.6 (a more recent version should work):

----

amazon-linux-extras install postgresql9.6

----

Finally, just follow the standad Rudder installation for xref:installation:server/rhel.adoc[RHEL/CentOS] documentation.
