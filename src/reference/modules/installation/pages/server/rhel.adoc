To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

yum install rudder-server

----

On Red Hat-like systems, a firewall setup is enabled by default, and would need to be adjusted
for Rudder to operate properly. You have to allow all the flows described in the
xref:installation:requirements.adoc#configure-the-network[network] section.

[TIP]

====

On EL7, the default firewall is firewalld, and you can enable HTTPS access by running:

----

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=443/tcp
