[WARNING]

====

Zypper seems to be quite tolerant to missing dependencies and will let you install rudder-server even if you are missing
something like +git-core+ for example, if nothing provides it or you did not install it beforehand.

Special care should be taken during initial installation not to say "Continue anyway" if Zypper does complain a dependency can
not be resolved and asks what to do.

====

== Add the Rudder packages repository
