= Rudder versions

== Rudder versioning

Rudder releases follow a `X.Y.Z` version scheme (for example, 6.1.2):

* *`X` version increments* are *major* releases. These versions include new features and architecture changes, and the amount of modifications can be considerable. An upgrade path from one major version to the next will always be provided (i.e., upgrading from 5 to 6 is supported, and from 6 to 7 is too, but upgrading directly from 5 to 7 will generally not be – check the xref:reference:installation:upgrade.adoc[upgrade section] of the user manual for specifics). They are released approximately every 9 to 12 months.
* *`Y` version increments* are *minor* releases. These versions include small new features and various improvements, but no major change in the architecture of Rudder. An upgrade path from one minor version to the next ones (for a given major version) will be provided – check the xref:reference:installation:upgrade.adoc[upgrade section] of the user manual for specifics). They are released every few months.
* *`Z` version increments* are *patch* releases. They contains bug or security fixes, and we make a lot of effort to reduce the amount of changes that go into these version (a full change log is always available). Upgrading your Rudder version to the latest patch release is always recommended, and is designed to be easy. They are released every few weeks.

== Rudder life cycle

A maintained version is a major version for which we release minor bug fix releases and communicate about security vulnerabilities.

* Our general policy is to *provide patch releases for an X.Y version during at least 3 months after the next minor or major version* is released to give some time for upgrading.
* For a slower major upgrade pace, Rudder subscription provides (among other benefits) *long-term maintenance of 18 to 24 months after release* (depending on the subscription level) for Rudder major versions, with a minimal upgrade window of 6 to 9 months. You can read more about it on the https://www.rudder.io/en/pricing/subscription/[subscription page].
