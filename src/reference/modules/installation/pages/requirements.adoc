== Browser support for UI

Rudder can be used with recent version (less than 2 years old) of Firefox, Chrome (and derivatives), and Edge.
Internet Explorer is not supported.

[[configure-the-network]]
== Network flows - Firewall configuration

The following network flows are used by Rudder for regular operations. Make sure your firewalls allow these connections.

[cols="<.^2,<.^2,<.^1,<.^3", options="header"]
|=======================
|From|To|Destination|Usage
|User or API client|Root| *tcp/443* | Access Web interface/API
|Node .3+|Relay/Root | *tcp/443* | Send reports and inventories, fetch files
|Linux/AIX node  | *tcp/5309* |Fetch policies
|Windows node  | *tcp/443* |Fetch policies
.2+|Relay .2+|Root | *tcp/443* | Send reports and inventories, fetch files
| *tcp/5309* |Fetch policies
|Relay/Root|Linux/AIX node | _tcp/5309_ .2+| *[optional]* Trigger remote agent run
|Root|Relay|_tcp/443_
|=======================

NOTE: If you still have pre-6.0 agents, or use the syslog-only report mode, you also need to have *udp/514* (or *tcp/514* depending on what you configured) open from nodes to relays or root, and from relays to root server.

=== Security

Your Rudder server and relays should generally not be exposed on the Internet. If you manage
nodes on remote networks, the usage of a VPN for Rudder communications is recommended.

By default, nodes listen on port 5309 to allow remote agent trigger. On nodes having public interfaces
it is recommended to only allow connection to this port from the server through firewall configuration.
You can also totally disable the service on simple nodes (but not server or relayd) if you don't want to use remote run with
`systemctl disable rudder-cf-serverd && systemctl restart rudder-agent` (or an equivalent Rudder policy).

=== DNS - Name resolution

If you want to be able to remotely trigger agent runs on nodes from the Root Server (without
having to wait for regular automated run),
you will need your Root Server (and Relay Servers, if applicable) to be able to resolve your nodes
using the provided hostname.

[[jvm-requirements]]
== JVM Security Policy

Rudder needs `unlimited strength` security policy because it uses a variety of advanced
hashing and cryptographic algorithms only available in that mode.

Any recent JVM (JDK 8 > 8u161, all JDK 9 and more recent) is configured by default with this policy.

You can check your case by running the following command on your server:

----

jrunscript -e 'exit (javax.crypto.Cipher.getMaxAllowedKeyLength("RC5") >= 256 ? 0 : 1);'; echo $?

----

If it returns 0, you have the correct policy. In other cases, you will need to change it.

For that, you can download the
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html[`unlimited strength` policy for JDK 8 here].


Then, simply copy the `java.policy` file into `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.policy`.

[[rudder-cloud-compatibility]]
== Cloud compatibility

The agent provides an abstraction that permits a high level management of the infrastructure.
This abstraction is independent of the underlying hardware. This also works for the cloud -
we can define configuration rules in Rudder that will be applied as well inside a cloud instance as in a virtual server or in a physical machine of a datacenter.

Any cloud instance based on one of the supported operating system is automatically supported.

[[node-hardware-requirements]]
== Hardware specifications for Rudder Agent

Rudder agent has a very small footprint, and only consumes:

* 10 to 20 MB of RAM during an agent run
* a few kB on the network to check or update its policies
* a few kB on the network to report
* around 100 MB of disk space for the installed files and the workspace

These figures will vary depending on your configuration (backup retention,
number of configured components to check, etc...).

[[server-hardware-requirements]]
== Hardware specifications and sizing for Rudder Root Server

A dedicated server is strongly recommended, either physical or virtual with at least one dedicated core.
Rudder Server runs on both 32 (if available) and 64 bit versions of every supported Operating System.

[NOTE]

====

Rudder does not fear big infrastructures. It is currently used in production in
infrastructure with more than *7000* nodes.

====

=== Memory

The required amount of RAM mainly depends on the number of managed nodes. A general rule for the minimal values, on a stand-alone server is:

* less than 50 nodes: 2 GB
* between 50 and 1000 nodes: 4 GB
* more than 1000 nodes: 4 GB + 1 GB of RAM by 500 nodes beyond 1000.

When your server has more than 2 GB of RAM, you have to configure the RAM allocated
to the Java Virtual Machine as explained in the section
xref:administration:performance.adoc#_configure_ram_allocated_to_jetty[about webapplication RAM configuration].

When your server has more than 4 GB, you may need to also tune the PostgresSQL
server, as explained in the xref:administration:performance.adoc#_optimize_postgresql_server[optimize PostgreSQL Server]
section.

[TIP]

====

As an example, a Rudder server which manages 2600 nodes (with a lot of policies
checked) will need:

* A server with 8 GB of RAM,
* 4 GB of RAM will be allocated to the JVM.

In our load-tests, with such a configuration, the server is not stressed and
the user experience is good.

====

=== CPU

The number of cores necessary also depends on the number of managed nodes. A general rule for the minimal values, on a stand-alone server is:
* less than 50 nodes: 2 cores
* between 50 and 1000 nodes: 4 cores
* more than 1000 nodes: 4 cores + one core per 1000 nodes beyond 1000, when not in full compliance
* more than 1000 nodes: 6 cores + one core per 500 nodes beyond 1000, when in full compliance

Adding more cores makes the Web Interface faster, and especially the policy generation part.
PostgreSQL and rsyslog both need more computing power when a lot of nodes are involved in full compliance, that's why the requirement grows more quickly.


=== Disk

To manage more than 100 nodes, it is strongly recommended to use SSD or NAS/SAN with low latency, to avoid slowdown during policy generation and inventories management.

The PostgreSQL database will take up most of the disk space needed by Rudder. The storage
necessary for the database can be estimated by counting around
500 to 900 kB per Directive per Node per Day of retention of node execution reports (default is 4 days),
plus 150 kB per Directive per Node per Day of archiving (default is 0 days),
plus 150 kB per Directive per Node per Day of compliance retention (default is 8 days) :

----
max_space = number of Directives * number of Nodes * ( retention duration in days * 900 kB + archive retention in days * 150 + compliance retention in days * 150 )
----

For example, a default installation with 500 nodes and an average of
50 Directives by node, should require between *76 GB and 114 GB* of disk space
for PostgreSQL.

Follow the xref:administration:performance.adoc#_reports_retention[reports Retention] section to configure the
retention duration.

[WARNING]

====

Be careful to correctly size your */var* partition. Compliance data are growing
fast, and PostgreSQL doesn't like at all to encounter a write error because
the disk is full. It is also adviced to set-up your monitoring to check for
available space on that partition.

Special attention should be given to:

=======

`/var/lib/pgsql`::
(OS dependent).
Please see above for more details about the
PostgreSQL database size estimation.

`/var/rudder`::
Contains most of your server information, the configuration repository, LDAP database, etc...
Rudder application-related files should stay under 1GB, but the size of the configuration-repository will
depend of the amount of data you store in it, especially in the shared-files folder (files that will get
distributed to the agents).

`/var/log/rudder`::
Report logs (`/var/log/rudder/reports`) size will depend on the amount of nodes you manage.
It is possible to reduce this drastically by unticking "Log all reports received to /var/log/rudder/reports/all.log"
under the *Administration -> Settings* tab in the Rudder web interface. This will prevent Rudder from recording this logs
in a text file on disk, and will only store them in the SQL database. This saves on space, and doesn't remove any
functionality, but does however make debugging harder.
