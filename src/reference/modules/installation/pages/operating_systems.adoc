== Fully supported Operating Systems

Fully supported Operating Systems are systems that we frequently build packages for and test on our servers.

[WARNING]

.Supporting Debian-based systems without systemd

====

It is possible to use Rudder on platforms without systemd, but systemd is required
by the package when the distribution supports it.
Please contact Rudder team if you want a package without systemd on a distribution
where systemd has been removed.

[[server-supported-os, the list of supported Operating Systems for Root server]]
=== For Rudder root server or relay server

The following operating systems are supported as a root or relay server:

[options="header"]
|===

| OS | Version | Architecture

| Debian | 9 and 10 | 64bit
| Ubuntu | 18.04 and 20.04 LTS | 64bit
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) / CentOS | 7 and 8 | 64bit
| SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) | 12 and 15 | 64bit

== Partially supported Operating Systems

Partially supported Operating Systems are systems that we have built packages for and tested at least once (in some cases, many more times) but that are not currently receiving continuous attention or bug fixes.

[WARNING]

.Partially supported Operating Systems

====

It is possible to use Rudder on other platforms than the fully supported ones.
However, some Techniques may not work properly. If you
wish to get Rudder support on those systems, please get in touch with us!

====

=== For Rudder Nodes

The following operating systems have had an agent built using xref:reference:build.adoc#_building_the_rudder_agent[Building the Rudder Agent]:

* FreeBSD
* Solaris 10 and 11

The following operating systems work with packages built for another operating system:

* OpenSUSE LEAP (with SLES packages)
* Amazon Linux and Amazon Linux 2 (with RHEL6 and 7 packages)

[TIP]

.Building an agent from source

====

You can also follow the xref:reference:build.adoc#_building_the_rudder_agent[build instructions] to build and install Rudder Agent locally on your favorite operating system.
Even if this OS has not been tested by us, there is a reasonable chance that the agent will work successfully.

====

=== For Rudder Root Server

We advise against using a partially supported OS for Rudder server because the server contains
much more code than the agent. This code is tailored against specific OS versions
to work around various system limitations and specificities.
