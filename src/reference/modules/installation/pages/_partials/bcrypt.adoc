[NOTE]
====

There is not default user anymore, you need to create a user after installation
with `rudder server create-user -u USERNAME`, and provide a secure password.

This prevents having a time frame after installation where the server is accessible from anyone,
and avoids Rudder servers left with open access.

====

[NOTE]
====

Rudder now provides bcrypt as hash type for local user passwords. It is the default
for new server, but upgraded servers will continue to use existing hashes.

It is advised to use bcrypt. To do so, you need to reset existing passwords and compute new hashes,
see xref:administration:users.adoc#user-management[user management documentation] for more details.
