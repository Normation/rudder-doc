[TIP]

====

If you are working on a test system, you can use the xref:quick_install.adoc[quick install script]:

----

curl https://repository.rudder.io/tools/rudder-setup | bash -s setup-server 6.2

----

That will automatically execute the installation, and you can go directly to the *Initial configuration* section below.
