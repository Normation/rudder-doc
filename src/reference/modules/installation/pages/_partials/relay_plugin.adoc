[WARNING]

====

Relay servers won't work if you don't have a valid scale-out-relay plugin installed.

If you install a relay without that plugin, policy generation will fail, preventing new policies to be applied to your Nodes.

More information about plugins in the xref:plugins:index.adoc[dedicated] section

[NOTE]

====

Relay servers are optional. 
You only need to install a relay server if you want to manage multiple networks from Rudder, without having 
to allow all the subnet access to Rudder server - typically for security reasons (DMZ, node isolation...).
