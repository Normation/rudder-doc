[[_technique_upgrade]]
=== Technique upgrade

At the first installation, Rudder will automatically deploy a technique library in the
`/var/rudder/configuration-repository/techniques` directory.

When upgrading Rudder to another version, a new (updated) technique library will be deployed
in `/opt/rudder/share/techniques`, and Rudder will only update the *system*
Techniques in the configuration-repository directory.

[TIP]

====

If you want to do any modification in a Technique from the standard library, it is recommended to create a whole new Technique (copy the source one with a new name and version), and do your changes in this new Technique. Thus, your standard library won't diverge from Rudder upstream one, and you will be able to benefit from its updates.

====


[CAUTION]

====

To upgrade your local techniques, run the following commands on the Rudder server.
If you have made any manual modifications to existing Techniques from the standard library, you will need to merge the changes during the techniques upgrade.

====



To upgrade your standard library's techniques, there are two possibilities


===== Default case: your standard technique library is pristine

If you did not modify any of the Technique from standard library (default case), or don't wish to keep any changes you made, you can override the Technique Library

----

rudder server upgrade-techniques -o

----

This command does not impact techniques created with the Technique Editor.

===== Special case: Techniques from standard library were modified


If you modified a Technique from the standard library and wish to keep the changes, changes will be performed in an update branch in the git repository
You will need to create the update branch if it is not already created, with the following command

----

$ rudder server upgrade-techniques  -i
Creating initial branch from an early commit
You have not provided an initial commit, we will use the first commit with techniques.
This can make the upgrade merge complex.
Use -c option to specify a more recent commit with no patch.

Type ctrl-c to abort now and return to continue.

----

If the branch already exists, you will get the following output

----

Creating initial branch from an early commit
The upgrade branch 'rudder_update' already exists, aborting

----

And then you can merge your changes in the upgraded Techniques with

----

# Upgrade the techniques
$ rudder server upgrade-techniques -u
Switched to branch 'rudder_update'
Switched to branch 'master'
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
ok: reload techniques from files.

----

Please note that you may have to manually fix the merge.

Finally, please check that the deployment is successful in the Rudder web interface.
