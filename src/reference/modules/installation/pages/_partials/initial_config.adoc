== Initial configuration

=== User account

Now the installation is complete you need to create a first user account. The easiest way is to
use the dedicated command to create a local admin user:

----
# Replace USERNAME by the user you want to create
rudder server create-user -u USERNAME
----

It will ask you a password twice and will create the user.

Read more about user account options in the xref:administration:users.adoc[dedicated section].

=== First connection

Once all these steps have been completed, use your web browser to go to the server URL.
Use your first user credentials to connect.

Now you should go to **Settings -> General -> Allowed Networks** and check that the networks listed there properly include all your nodes network addresses.
By default, this will contain your server's attached networks.

The setup of the Rudder server is now over. If you plan to manage hundreds or thousands of nodes,
please note that some xref:administration:performance.adoc#_performance_tuning[performance tuning] can be necessary on the system.
