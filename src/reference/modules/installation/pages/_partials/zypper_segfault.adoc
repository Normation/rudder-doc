[WARNING]

====

You may encounter a segmentation fault in Zypper in the following cases:

* On SLES 11 when trying to install Rudder rpm files locally with Zypper
(for example with 'zypper install rudder-agent-version.release-1.SLES.11.x86_64.rpm')
* On SLES 12 GA when installing Rudder packages, locally or from the repository

This is due to a bug (https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=889363[bnc#929483] on SUSE bugtracker) in Zypper's RPM headers parsing.
You can either:

* Only for SLES 11, install the packages directly from the repository, as described below
* Upgrade your libzypp package to a version including the fix provided by SuSE (upgrade for http://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=42q80kCaQxE[SLES11SP3] and
  for http://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=0cI2ELIttrI[SLES12]) 
* Use the rpm command to install packages locally (for example with `rpm -i rudder-agent-version.release-1.SLES.11.x86_64.rpm`)
