To complete this step, please make sure that your node is configured successfully
and appears in your Rudder web interface.

== On the root server

You have to tell the Rudder root server that a node will be a relay. To do so,
launch the rudder-node-to-relay script on the root server, supplying the UUID of the
host to be considered as a relay. You can find the UUID of your node with the
`rudder agent info` command.

== Validation

When every step has completed successfully:

- The Rudder root server will recognize the new node as a relay
- It will generate specific policies for the relay
- The relay will update and switch to his new role

This is an example of node details pane showing a relay server. Note the "Role:
Rudder relay server" part that shows that the machine has successfully changed
from a node to a relay.

== Adding nodes to a relay server

When you have at least one relay, you will likely want to add nodes
on it.

You then have two possible cases:

- You want to switch an already existing node to the relay
- You want to add a new one

The procedure on both cases is the same, you have to:

- Update the policy server with the IP address or the fully qualified domain name of the relay server
(instead of the root server)

----

rudder agent policy-server <rudder relay ip or hostname>                                                     

----


- Trigger an inventory immediately to make sure the node is registered correctly

After those steps, the node should be registered correctly on your Rudder
infrastructure.
