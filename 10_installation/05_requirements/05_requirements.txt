===== Mandatory flows

The following flows from the Nodes to the Rudder Root Server have to be allowed:

include::../../glossary/port-443-nodes.txt[]

include::../../glossary/port-514.txt[]

And this one is optional:

===== DNS - Name resolution

By default, Rudder relies on the Node declared hostnames to identify them, for
security reasons. It is required that each Node hostname can be resolved to its
IP address that will be used to contact the Rudder Server.

If you can not make every node resolution consistent, it is possible to remove
this constraint by unticking "Use reverse DNS lookups on nodes to reinforce
authentication to policy server:" in the Administration - Settings tab of the
Rudder web interface.
