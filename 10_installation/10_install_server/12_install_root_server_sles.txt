==== Install Rudder Root server on SLES

===== Configure the package manager

Rudder requires Java RE (version 7 at least) that is not always packaged by SuSE on all versions

* PostgreSQL 9
* Java RE (version 8 at least).

It is also recommended to use PostgreSQL >= 9.2 for optimal performances.

PostgreSQL 9.4 can be installed through the OpenSuSE build service: https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/server:database:postgresql
or through the system repositories, on SLES 11 SP4 and later systems.

The Java RE 8 for SLES11 can be found through Oracle's website: https://www.java.com

Also, Rudder server requires the +git+ software, that can be found on SLES SDK DVD under the name +git-core+.

[WARNING]

====

SLES 11 pre SP4 will try to install PostgreSQL 8.x by default, which is not recommended for Rudder and will cause serious performance degradation, and requires much more disk space in the long run.

It is really recommended to either add the OpenSuSE build service repository, or install postgresql9x-server (if available) beforehand to prevent the system from choosing the default PostgreSQL version.

[WARNING]

====

Zypper seems to be quite tolerant to missing dependencies and will let you install rudder-server-root even if you are missing
something like +git-core+ for example, if nothing provides it or you did not install it beforehand.

Special care should be taken during initial installation not to say "Continue anyway" if Zypper does complain a dependency can
not be resolved and asks what to do.

====

===== Add the Rudder packages repository

include::snippets/rpm_key.txt.snippet[]

Then run the following commands as root:

----

zypper ar -n "Rudder SLES repository" http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-4.2/SLES_11/ Rudder
zypper refresh

----

This will add the Rudder package repository, then update the local package
cache.

===== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

zypper in rudder-server-root

----
