==== Install Rudder Root server on SLES

===== Configure the package manager

Rudder requires three packages that are not always packaged by SuSE on all versions:

* PostgreSQL 9
* Java RE (version 8 at least).

PostgreSQL 9 can be installed through the OpenSuSE build service: https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/server:database:postgresql
or through the system repositories, on post-SP1 systems.

The Java RE 8 for SLES11 can be found through Oracle's website: https://www.java.com

Also, Rudder server requires the +git+ software, that can be found on SLES SDK DVD under the name +git-core+.

[WARNING]

====

SLES 11 will try to install PostgreSQL 8.3 by default, which is not supported by Rudder and will cause various glitches
in the web interface, as well as reporting failures.

It is really mandatory to either add the OpenSuSE build service repository, or install postgresql91-server (if available)
beforehand to prevent the system from choosing the default PostgreSQL implementation.

===== Add the Rudder packages repository

include::snippets/rpm_key.txt.snippet[]

Then run the following commands as root:

----

zypper ar -n "Rudder SLES repository" http://www.rudder-project.org/rpm-4.1/SLES_11/ Rudder
zypper refresh

----

This will add the Rudder package repository, then update the local package
cache.

===== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

zypper in rudder-server-root

----

[WARNING]

====

Zypper seems to be quite tolerant to missing dependencies and will let you install rudder-server-root even if you are missing
something like +git-core+ for example, if nothing provides it or you did not install it beforehand.

Special care should be taken during initial installation not to say "Continue anyway" if Zypper does complain a dependency can
not be resolved and asks what to do.
