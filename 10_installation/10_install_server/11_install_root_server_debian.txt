==== Install Rudder Root server on Debian or Ubuntu

===== Add the Rudder packages repository

Rudder 4.1 requires Java RE (version 8 at least) which is not packaged by default on Debian 7 nor Ubuntu 14.04.

The Java RE 8 for Debian or Ubuntu can be found through Oracle's website: https://www.java.com

Then run the following commands as root:

----

echo "deb http://www.rudder-project.org/apt-4.1/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rudder.list
apt-get update

----

This will add the package repository and finally update the local package cache.

===== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

apt-get install rudder-server-root

----

[WARNING]

=====

Any nodes running *syslogd* (not syslog-ng or rsyslog) will *fail* to send any
reports about the configuration rules they have applied to a Rudder Server running
on Ubuntu (and only on Ubuntu). Rudder will apply rules on nodes but will never get
reports from them. Therefore Rudder will not be able to calculate compliance.

The only supported platform using syslogd by default is *RHEL/CentOS 5*, and several
workarounds are available to fix this:

. Install another syslog server on your nodes, such as rsyslog or syslog-ng.
. Change the rsyslog configuration on the Rudder server (running Ubuntu 12.04
  or later) to use port 514 and authorize this in the rsyslog configuration.
. Setup iptables on the node to send syslog traffic to the correct port on
  your Rudder server.
. Use a different OS for your Rudder server that Ubuntu Server 12.04 or later.
