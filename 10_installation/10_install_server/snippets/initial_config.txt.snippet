==== Initial configuration of your Rudder Root Server

After the installation, you have to configure some system elements, by launching
the following initialisation script:

----

/opt/rudder/bin/rudder-init

----

This script will ask you to fill in the following details:

=====

Allowed networks:: A list of IP networks authorized to connect to the server.
It uses the network/CIDR mask notation, for instance +192.168.0.0/24+ or
+10.0.0.0/8+.
To add several networks, first type the first network, then press
the return key - the script will ask if you wish to add some more networks.
Also, the allowed networks can be adjusted later in the web interface
in the Administration - Settings tab without having to run the script
again.

=====

[TIP]

=====

In case of typing error, or if you wish to reconfigure Rudder, you can
execute this script again as many times as you want.

=====

==== Validate the installation

Once all these steps have been completed, use your web browser to go to the URL
given in the output of `rudder-init`.

You should see a loading screen, then a login prompt. The default login is "admin" with
password "admin", authenticating you in the Rudder web interface with full administrative privileges.
You are strongly advised to <<_passwords, change this password>> as soon as possible.

The setup of the Rudder server is now over. If you plan to manage hundreds or thousands of Nodes,
please note that some <<_performance_tuning, performance tuning>> can be necessary on the system.
