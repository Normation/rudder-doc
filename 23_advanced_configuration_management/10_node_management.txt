=== Node management

==== Reinitialize policies for a Node

To reinitialize the policies for a Node, delete the local copy of the Applied
Policies fetched from the Rudder Server, and create a new local copy of the
initial promises.

----

root@node:~# rm -rf /var/rudder/cfengine-community/inputs/*
root@node:~# cp -a /opt/rudder/share/initial-promises/* /var/rudder/cfengine-community/inputs/

----

At next run of the Rudder Agent (it runs every five minutes), the initial promises will be used. 

[CAUTION]

====

Use this procedure with caution: the Applied Policies of a Node should never get
broken, unless some major change has occurred on the Rudder infrastructure, like
a full reinstallation of the Rudder Server.
