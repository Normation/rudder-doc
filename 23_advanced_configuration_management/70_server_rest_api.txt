=== REST API

Rudder can be used as a web service using a REST API. 

This documentation covers the version 1 of Rudder's API, that has been present since
Rudder 2.4.

The version 2 has now been implemented, which is much more complete, in Rudder 2.7, and
has a dedicated documentation available here: http://www.rudder-project.org/rudder-api-doc/

[WARNING] 

====

The version 1 is to be considered legacy and should not be used anymore. Please migrate to
version 2 to benefit from the new authentication features and more complete existing methods.

====


==== Default setup

Access to REST API can be either using Rudder authentication, either
unauthenticated, using authentication mechanisms set elsewhere, for instance at
Apache level.

===== Rudder Authentication

By default, the access to the REST API is open to users not authenticated in
Rudder.

The method of authentication can be configured in
+/opt/rudder/etc/rudder-web.properties+

----

rudder.rest.allowNonAuthenticatedUser=true

----

===== Apache access rules

By default, the REST API is exposed for localhost only, at +http://localhost/rudder/api+.

.Example usage of non authenticated REST API

====

Unrestricted access can be granted to local scripts accessing to +localhost+,
whereas remote access to the REST API will be either denied, or restricted
through autentication at apache level.

====

===== User for REST actions

Actions done using the REST API are logged by default as run by the user
+UnknownRestUser+.

To change the name of this user, add following header to the HTTP request:

----

X-REST-USERNAME: MyConfiguredRestUser

----

If the REST API is authenticated, the authenticated user name will be used in the
logs.

==== Status

+http://localhost/rudder/api/status+::

Check if Rudder server is up and return +OK+. 
If Rudder server is not responding, an error is displayed.

==== Promises regeneration

+http://localhost/rudder/api/deploy/reload+::

Regenerate promises (same action as the +Regenerate now+ button).

==== Dynamic groups regeneration

+http://localhost/rudder/api/dyngroup/reload+::

Check all dynamic groups for changes. If changes have occurred, regenerate the
groups in the LDAP and the CFEngine promises.

==== Technique library reload

+http://localhost/rudder/api/techniqueLibrary/reload+::

Check the technique library for changes. If changes have occurred, reload the
technique library in memory and regenerate the CFEngine promises.

==== Archives manipulation

Various methods are available to import and export items:

===== Archiving:

+http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/archive/groups+::

Export node groups and node groups categories.

+http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/archive/directives+::

Export policy library (categories, active techniques, directives).

+http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/archive/rules+::

Export rules

+http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/archive/full+::

Export everything

===== Listing:


+http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/list/groups+::

List available archives datetime for groups (the datetime is in the format
awaited for restoration).

+http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/list/directives+::

List available archives datetime for policy library (the datetime is in the
format awaited for restoration).

+http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/list/rules+::

List available archives datetime for configuration rules (the datetime is in the
format awaited for restoration).

+http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/list/full+::

List available archives datetime for full archives (the datetime is in the
format awaited for restoration).

===== Restoring a given archive:

`http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/groups/datetime/[archiveId]`::

Restore given groups archive.

`http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/directives/datetime/[archiveId]`::

Restore given directives archive.

`http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/rules/datetime/[archiveId]`::

Restore given rules archive.

`http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/full/datetime/[archiveId]`::

Restore everything.

===== Restoring the latest available archive (from a previously archived action, and so from a Git tag):

----

http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/groups/latestArchive
http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/directives/latestArchive
http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/rules/latestArchive
http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/full/latestArchive

----

===== Restoring the latest available commit (use Git HEAD):

---- 

http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/groups/latestCommit
http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/directives/latestCommit
http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/rules/latestCommit
http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/restore/full/latestCommit

----

===== Downloading a ZIP archive

The REST API allows to download a ZIP archive of groups, directives and 
rules (as XML files) for a given Git commit ID (the commit HASH). 

It is not designed to query for available Git commit ID, so you will need to get 
it directly from a Git tool (for example with Git log) or from the list API. 

Note that that API allows to download ANY Git commit ID as a ZIP archive, 
not only the one corresponding to Rudder archives. 

Note 2: you should rename the resulting file with a ".zip" extension as
most zip utilities won't work correctly on a file not having it. 

`http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/zip/groups/[GitCommitId]`::

Download groups for the given Commit ID as a ZIP archive. 

`http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/zip/directives/[GitCommitId]`::

Download directives for the given Commit ID as a ZIP archive. 

`http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/zip/rules/[archiveId]`::

Download rules for the given Commit ID as a ZIP archive. 

`http://localhost/rudder/api/archives/zip/full/[archiveId]`::

Download groups, directives and rules for the given Commit ID as a ZIP archive.
