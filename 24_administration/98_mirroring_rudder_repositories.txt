=== Mirroring Rudder repositories

You can also use your own packages repositories server instead of 'www.rudder-project.org' if you want. This is possible with a synchronization from our repositories with rsync.

We've got public read only rsync modules 'rudder-apt' and 'rudder-rpm'.

To synchronize with the APT repository just type:
----
rsync -av www.rudder-project.org::rudder-apt /your/local/mirror
----

To synchronize with the RPM repository just type:
----
rsync -av www.rudder-project.org::rudder-rpm /your/local/mirror
----

Finally, you have to set up these directories (/your/local/mirror) to be shared by HTTP by a web server (i.e., Apache, nginx, lighttpd, etc...).
