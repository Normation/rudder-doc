=== Initial configuration of your Rudder Root Server

After the installation, you have to configure some system elements, by launching
the following initialization script:

----

/opt/rudder/bin/rudder-init.sh

----

This script will ask you to fill in the following details:

====

Hostname:: The hostname that can be used by the client Nodes to reach the
server. It is used to configure the web interface (so it will be the URL you'll
use to access it), and to configure on the client Node how to reach the root
server.

Allowed networks:: A list of IP networks authorized to connect to the server. We
recommend that you specify all the networks of your infrastructure. The syntax
is the standard network/mask notation, for instance +192.168.0.0/24+ or
+10.0.0.0/8+. To add several networks, first type the first network, then press
the return key - the script will ask if you wish to add some more networks.

Server IP:: The IP address of the Rudder Root Server on which the CFEngine
daemon should be contacted by all nodes. If your root server has only one IP
address, you should nevertheless type it here.

Demo data:: Type "yes" if you wish to have the local database filed with demo
data. It is usually not recommended if you wish to add your own Nodes.

Reset initial promises:: On an existing Rudder Server, you can remove all
promises generated by Rudder and replace them by the standard initialisation
promises. The major effect of this option is that all Nodes won't be able to
fetch their promises until the next regeneration by Rudder.

[TIP]

====

In case of typing error, or if you wish to reconfigure these elements, you can
execute this script again as many times as you want.
