== Install Rudder Server

This chapter covers the installation of a Rudder Root Server, from the
specification of the underlying server, to the initial setup of the application.

Before all, you need to setup a server according to 
<<Server_supported_OS, the server specifications>>. You should also
<<configure_the_network, configure the network>>. These topics are covered in the
Architecture chapter.

Ideally, this machine should have Internet access, but this is not a strict requirement.

As Rudder datas can grow really fast depending on your number of managed nodes and number of rules, it is advised to separate partitions to prevent your /var getting full and break your system.
Special attention should be given to:

======

/var/lib/pgsql::
Or wherever is located your postgresql database.
Can grow by several GB per day.

/var/rudder::
Contains most of your server information, LDAP database, etc..
Slower growth over time.

/var/log/rudder:: 
Reports logs can easily grow to 1.5GB per day.
