=== Install Rudder Root server on Debian or Ubuntu

==== Update the system

Prior to beginning the installation of your Rudder Server, we recommend that you
update your Debian/Ubuntu system with the latest versions of available packages.

Specifically for Debian 5 (Lenny), since the release of Debian 6 (Squeeze), the signing key of
packages repositories has changed. If you haven't already done it, you should
also force the upgrade of the +debian-archive-keyring+ package to fetch the new key:

----

root@rudder-server:~# aptitude update
root@rudder-server:~# aptitude install debian-archive-keyring
root@rudder-server:~# aptitude update
root@rudder-server:~# aptitude safe-upgrade

----

==== Add the Rudder packages repository

To validate the contents of the Rudder repository, you should import the GPG
key used to sign it:

----

root@rudder-server:~# apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 474A19E8

----

If the HTTP Keyserver Protocol (11371/tcp) port is blocked on your network you
can use this alternate command:

----

root@rudder-server:~# wget --quiet -O- "http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x474A19E8" | sudo apt-key add -

----


Then add the Rudder repository, by typing:

----

root@rudder-server:~# echo "deb http://www.rudder-project.org/apt-2.4/ $(lsb_release -cs) main contrib non-free" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rudder.list

----

Then, update your local package database to retrieve the list of packages
available on our repository:

----

root@rudder-server:~# aptitude update

----

==== Java on Debian/Ubuntu

The Rudder Root server needs a compatible 'Java Runtime Environment' to run.
In most cases, this will be installed automatically thanks to packaging
dependencies, however in some cases manual installation is required.

On 'Debian Squeeze (6)' and 'Debian Lenny (5)', the available package is 'Oracle Java 6
JRE', namely +sun-java-6-jre+, which is in the 'non-free' component. You must
make sure this is enabled in your apt sources. Check that
+/etc/apt/sources.list+ contains the following lines:

----

deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main contrib non-free

----
[TIP]

====

Your mirror may differ, +ftp.fr.debian.org+ is only an example. Also, please
adapt the distribution name if needed (+squeeze+ could be replaced by +lenny+).

====


On 'Ubuntu Natty (11.04)' and previous Ubuntu versions, you will have to
install Java yourself as the packaging of the Oracle JVM is now restricted by
Oracle(TM) and Rudder is not compatible with OpenJDK 6, which is the only
available JDK from Ubuntu. See http://www.java.com/fr/download/ to get
Oracle's JVM.

On 'Debian Wheezy (7)' and above and 'Ubuntu Oneiric (11.10)' and above, the
available package is 'OpenJDK 7 JRE', namely +openjdk-7-jre+. It will be
installed automatically as a dependency of the Rudder packages, and does not
require the non-free component.


==== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

root@rudder-server:~# aptitude install rudder-server-root

----

[NOTE]

====

If 'Oracle Java 6 JRE' is installed (usually on Debian Lenny (5) or Squeeze
(6) only), you will be asked to accept the license of the product during
installation.

====

==== Compatibility with RHEL/CentOS 5 and syslogd

[WARNING]

====

For users running the Rudder *server* on Ubuntu Server 12.04 or later, any
nodes running syslogd (not syslog-ng or rsyslog) will fail to send any
reports about the configuration rules they have applied. This is the case by
default on RHEL/CentOS 5, but not on any other supported platforms.

Rudder will apply rules on nodes but will never get reports from those using syslogd.
Therefore Rudder will not be able to calculate compliance.

Several workarounds are available to fix this:

. Install another syslog server on your nodes, such as rsyslog or syslog-ng.
. Change the rsyslog configuration on the Rudder server (running Ubuntu 12.04
  or later) to use port 514 and authorize this in the rsyslog configuration.
. Setup iptables on the node to send syslog traffic to the correct port on
  your Rudder server.
. Use a different OS for your Rudder server that Ubuntu Server 12.04 or later.
