=== Install Rudder Root server on Debian

==== Add the main, contrib and non-free components

Ensure that the +apt+ package manager is configured to use these three components,
by checking that +/etc/apt/sources.list+ contains the following lines:

----

deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main contrib non-free

----

[TIP]

====

Your mirror may differ, +ftp.fr.debian.org+ is only an example. Also, please
adapt the distribution name if needed.

Your Linux distribution may differ too, +squeeze+ could be replaced by +lenny+.

The Rudder Root server needs a compatible Java Runtime Environment to run.

On Debian Squeeze and Debian Lenny, the available package is Oracle(TM) Java 6
JRE, namely sun-java-6-jre, which is in the non-free component.

On Debian Wheezy and above, the available package is OpenJDK 7 JRE, namely
openjdk-7-jre.

You can get the Java JRE 6 here : http://www.java.com

==== Update the system

Prior to beginning the installation of your Rudder Server, we recommend that you
update your Debian system with the latest versions of available packages.
Especially for Debian 5 (Lenny), since the release of Debian 6.0 (Squeeze), the
signing key of packages repositories has changed. If you haven't already done
it, you should 
force the upgrade of the +debian-archive-keyring+ package to fetch the new key:

----

root@rudder-server:~# aptitude update
root@rudder-server:~# aptitude install debian-archive-keyring
root@rudder-server:~# aptitude update
root@rudder-server:~# aptitude safe-upgrade

----

==== Add the Rudder packages repository

To validate the content of the Normation repository, you should import the GPG
key used to sign it:

----

root@rudder-server:~# apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 474A19E8

----

If your HTTP Keyserver Protocol (11371/tcp) is blocked you can use an alternate command:

----

root@rudder-server:~# wget --quiet -O- "http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x474A19E8" | sudo apt-key add -

----


Then add the URL of the Normation repository, by typing:

----

root@rudder-server:~# echo "deb http://www.rudder-project.org/apt-2.3/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rudder.list

----

Then, update your local package database to retrieve the list of packages
available on our repository:

----

root@rudder-server:~# aptitude update

----

==== Install your Rudder Root Server

To begin the installation, you should simply install the rudder-server-root
metapackage, which will install the required components:

----

root@rudder-server:~# aptitude install rudder-server-root

----

Rudder uses the Oracle Java virtual machine. To install it, you must accept
its license.
